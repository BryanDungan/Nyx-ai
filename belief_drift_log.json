those moments can truly captivate a person\u2019s imagination. you could also make the case that when you witness the sunrise from a mountain top or see the sun set from the backdrop of a vast ocean, witnessing those natural occurrences are too beautiful to be put into words.  sunrises and sunsets never get old for me because they are never the same and they are always different depending upon which environment you\u2019re witnessing them in. it only takes a few minutes to stop what you\u2019re doing in your hectic day-to-day life to really enjoy the spectacle of the sun\u2019s rising and setting. it\u2019s also a reminder about how our time here on earth is limited and that there are cosmic occurrences that happen beyond our control and our understanding.  i think this is mainly why solar eclipses are so powerful to witness in person because you\u2019re seeing an event that is beyond human control and that only comes around once or twice in a lifetime. those men, women, and children who traveled hundreds or thousands of miles to see the recent solar eclipse occur across the continental united states are in touch with their sense of wonder, and they believe in its\u2019 ability to make you feel astonished, wowed, and even humbled.  witnessing the sun\u2019s and the moon\u2019s movements aren\u2019t the only ways to cause yourself to feel wonder though. there are hundreds, if not thousands of possibilities out there that will make your jaw drop in disbelief. i have always thought of photography as a good way to capture the wonders of the world, and i have taken many photos throughout my previous travels in order to really remember those special moments of life when i was on the road. beyond just taking photos, it\u2019s really wonderful to interact with your environment by jumping in a freezing lake, hiking up a mountain, smelling different flowers in a garden, rafting down a streaming river, etc. those moments really make you feel alive and help to maintain a sense of wonder about the world.  you don\u2019t have to travel, take photos, or be an adventure junkie to have a sense of wonder though. if you\u2019re willing to challenge yourself by learning new things and bettering yourself, that will help you maintain a healthy curiosity about life and a thirst for knowledge. whether its\u2019 learning a new trade, developing a website, or speaking a new language, the pursuit of knowledge in different areas is a great idea and the things you will learn about yourself and the world around you will captivate and excite you. if you\u2019re curious, confident, and willing to have an open mind, the world will teach you many things if you open yourself up to the possibilities.  never let the flame inside you go out. as a child, you definitely did not have worry about wonder because you always had it and every day, you most likely had energy and a curiosity not easily extinguished. however, when you get older and more accustomed to the ways of the world, it can be very tempting to think of everything as mundane, childish, and routine, but that\u2019s simply not how it should be.  however, the differences that occur when you\u2019re a teenager or a fully-grown adult is that you have to pursue the wonder for yourself. you have to take the time and put yourself out there to figure out what really captivates you. everybody has a unique way of seeing the world but make sure it\u2019s not always from a serious and pessimistic point of view. let yourself be wowed by the unknown or by the newly discovered. pursue the passions and the beauty in life based on what fills your heart or your mind up.  for some, it may be playing jazz music and for others, it may be hiking through the mountains. the best thing about experiencing wonder is that it is ever-present in our lives but you have to be aware of what reaches out to you and touches your soul. most people live out their lives not fully embracing the wonders around them.  you have to be always on the lookout for what fills your heart up with joy and happiness whether it\u2019s a watching beautiful sunset over the water, viewing an original painting by claude monet, or playing beethoven in a symphony orchestra as your friends and family sit in the audience. always be looking out for the wonders in life, otherwise, you\u2019ll never find them at all.  wonder beauty enjoyment satisfaction life lessons",

    "old_belief": "\u201cif you were to define the word \u2018wonder\u2019, you would characterize it as meaning a feeling of amazement or admiration caused by seeing or witnessing something beautiful, unexpected, captivating, and inexplicable.\u201d   if you were to define the word \u2018wonder\u2019, you would characterize it as meaning a feeling of amazement or admiration caused by seeing or witnessing something beautiful, unexpected, captivating, and inexplicable. when you are a child, it\u2019s easy to have that sense of wonder about the world. your sense of curiosity and disbelief is quite high and your imagination can run wild believing in the possibilities of the unknown.  even as we grow older and become adults, we still have a sense of wonder that never fully leaves us and is part of our essence as human beings. while you may not have the same sense or amount of wonder as you did when you were a child, it\u2019s important to never fully extinguish that feeling and to let it stay within you even if you are an adult or in your elderly years.  having a sense of wonder connects you to your childhood years and reignites the kid within you because that part of your being never truly goes away unless you let it. by maintaining that curiosity and desire to know about the world, this helps us keep our sense of wonder about life and its\u2019 beauty. it can be easy nowadays to be jaded about the state of the world and to think that everything is going to hell in a handbasket.  while there are certainly serious problems to be fixed in our ever-changing and complicated world, being doom and gloom about it 24 / 7 won\u2019t make you feel any better. you have to maintain the ability to never be too down or be too up about your surroundings. while there can be a lot of ugliness to be found, there is also a staggering amount of beauty to be in awe about.  i believe that it can be much easier to see things through a negative lens and seek out the ugliness in life. it\u2019s harder yet much more rewarding to seek out the beauty and wonder that you can find if you know where to look. you also have to take the time to enjoy the beauty of things and open yourself up to the beauty of the world. while it may be clich\u00e9 to state this, you have to have an open heart and an open mind. if you close yourself off to the wonders of life, you\u2019ll never really be able to appreciate them fully.  a sense of wonder has to be cultivated over a long period of time and doesn\u2019t happen overnight. when you are a child, you\u2019re amazed by anything and almost everything new and unique. as you get older and you experience more of life, it can be more and more difficult to feel amazement or be captivated by life. each person has a different sense of wonder, and different things amaze different people. when i think about wonder though, there are a few things that cause me to feel that unexpected thrill or captivation.  i think most people would agree that a sunrise or a sunset could really create awe and wonder in a person. the colors and the vibrancy of the environment when the sun lights up your world at dawn\u2019s break or when it fades into darkness to make way for the stars and night sky; those moments can truly captivate a person\u2019s imagination. you could also make the case that when you witness the sunrise from a mountain top or see the sun set from the backdrop of a vast ocean, witnessing those natural occurrences are too beautiful to be put into words.  sunrises and sunsets never get old for me because they are never the same and they are always different depending upon which environment you\u2019re witnessing them in. it only takes a few minutes to stop what you\u2019re doing in your hectic day-to-day life to really enjoy the spectacle of the sun\u2019s rising and setting. it\u2019s also a reminder about how our time here on earth is limited and that there are cosmic occurrences that happen beyond our control and our understanding.  i think this is mainly why solar eclipses are so powerful to witness in person because you\u2019re seeing an event that is beyond human control and that only comes around once or twice in a lifetime. those men, women, and children who traveled hundreds or thousands of miles to see the recent solar eclipse occur across the continental united states are in touch with their sense of wonder, and they believe in its\u2019 ability to make you feel astonished, wowed, and even humbled.  witnessing the sun\u2019s and the moon\u2019s movements aren\u2019t the only ways to cause yourself to feel wonder though. there are hundreds, if not thousands of possibilities out there that will make your jaw drop in disbelief. i have always thought of photography as a good way to capture the wonders of the world, and i have taken many photos throughout my previous travels in order to really remember those special moments of life when i was on the road. beyond just taking photos, it\u2019s really wonderful to interact with your environment by jumping in a freezing lake, hiking up a mountain, smelling different flowers in a garden, rafting down a streaming river, etc. those moments really make you feel alive and help to maintain a sense of wonder about the world.  you don\u2019t have to travel, take photos, or be an adventure junkie to have a sense of wonder though. if you\u2019re willing to challenge yourself by learning new things and bettering yourself, that will help you maintain a healthy curiosity about life and a thirst for knowledge. whether its\u2019 learning a new trade, developing a website, or speaking a new language, the pursuit of knowledge in different areas is a great idea and the things you will learn about yourself and the world around you will captivate and excite you. if you\u2019re curious, confident, and willing to have an open mind, the world will teach you many things if you open yourself up to the possibilities.  never let the flame inside you go out. as a child, you definitely did not have worry about wonder because you always had it and every day, you most likely had energy and a curiosity not easily extinguished. however, when you get older and more accustomed to the ways of the world, it can be very tempting to think of everything as mundane, childish, and routine, but that\u2019s simply not how it should be.  however, the differences that occur when you\u2019re a teenager or a fully-grown adult is that you have to pursue the wonder for yourself. you have to take the time and put yourself out there to figure out what really captivates you. everybody has a unique way of seeing the world but make sure it\u2019s not always from a serious and pessimistic point of view. let yourself be wowed by the unknown or by the newly discovered. pursue the passions and the beauty in life based on what fills your heart or your mind up.  for some, it may be playing jazz music and for others, it may be hiking through the mountains. the best thing about experiencing wonder is that it is ever-present in our lives but you have to be aware of what reaches out to you and touches your soul. most people live out their lives not fully embracing the wonders around them.  you have to be always on the lookout for what fills your heart up with joy and happiness whether it\u2019s a watching beautiful sunset over the water, viewing an original painting by claude monet, or playing beethoven in a symphony orchestra as your friends and family sit in the audience. always be looking out for the wonders in life, otherwise, you\u2019ll never find them at all.  wonder beauty enjoyment satisfaction life lessons",

    "new_belief": "emotional connection, in the context of dreams, refers to the strong link between our emotional state during waking hours and the emotional content of our dreams. dreams are often seen as a reflection of our unconscious mind, and they can process and resolve emotional conflicts experienced during the day. for example, if someone is experiencing fear or anxiety during the day, these emotions may be prominent in their dreams.  here's a more detailed explanation: 1. dreams as a reflection of emotions: dreams are not just random images; they are often linked to our emotional experiences.  emotions experienced during the day can manifest in dreams, either directly or symbolically.  for instance, if someone has been feeling sad or stressed, their dreams might reflect those emotions.  2. dreams and emotional regulation: some studies suggest that dreams, particularly those in rem sleep, play a role in processing and resolving emotional conflicts.  emotionally intense dreams may help individuals process and integrate difficult feelings, potentially leading to improved moods the next day.  dreams can also be a way to work through unresolved emotions and gain insights into our inner world.  3. examples of emotional connections in dreams: fear and anxiety: dreams might feature scenarios involving danger, loss, or overwhelming situations, reflecting feelings of anxiety or fear. sadness and loss: dreams may involve themes of separation, grief, or loss, mirroring emotional pain or sadness. anger and frustration: dreams could feature confrontations, arguments, or acts of aggression, reflecting feelings of anger or frustration.  4. how to interpret emotional dreams: pay attention to the overall emotional tone of your dreams. consider the symbols and imagery in your dreams, as they can be metaphors for deeper emotions. reflect on your waking life and any events that might be contributing to the emotions you are experiencing in your dreams.",

    "old_belief": "but others believe they don\u2019t many experts don\u2019t believe dreams have much meaning, but believe they still serve a purpose.  existing theories outline a few of these purposes.  threat simulation theory some researchers suggest that dreams serve an important evolutionary purpose.  according to threat simulation theory, dreams offer the chance to practice identifying, avoiding, and dealing with potential threats. by safely handling these threats in your dreams, you might feel safer in your waking life.  research from 2009trusted source found some support for this theory by comparing dreams of children who had experienced trauma with children who hadn\u2019t.  of course, threat simulation theory can also tie into other theories about dream meaning. traumatized children could, for example, have more threatening dreams, because they often feel afraid in daily life.  activation-synthesis theory according to the activation-synthesis theory, dreams are nothing more than a collection of random images and thoughts, projected during sleep as a result of normal brain activity.  these images don\u2019t follow any narrative structure, thanks to the pons, your brain\u2019s random dream generator. you create the story of your dream on your own, after waking up.  supporters of this theory believe dreams can feel strange, because these random images often make little sense when they\u2019re combined.  dreams as emotional regulation the unpleasant or unwanted emotions you experience in daily life can pop up in your dreams, too.  anxiety, guilt, sadness, or fear can quickly get overwhelming. but some experts have theorized that navigating these feelings in dreamland can help you begin resolving these feelings without all the stress.  wondering how that might work? well, when you dream during the rapid eye movement (rem) stage of sleep, the parts of the brain that help regulate emotion and memory are active.  what\u2019s not active is the chemical messenger noradrenalinetrusted source, which can produce feelings of anxiety or stress.  continual-activation theory your brain doesn\u2019t completely shut down when you go to sleep. instead, it uses this time to carry out important processes, including transferring short-term memories into long-term storage.  as you sleep, your brain also takes out the trash, in a manner of speaking, by getting rid of all the leftover, unnecessary information.  as your unconscious brain focuses on processing memories, activity in your conscious brain slows way down.  according to the continual-activation theory, this prompts your brain to send a flow of data from memory storage into the conscious brain. you can think of this data \u2014 aka your dreams \u2014 as a sort of screensaver keeping the conscious part of your brain up and running, despite the lack of actual activity.",

    "old_belief": "you\u2019re walking down a hazy road lined with antique streetlamps. the lights are glowing, faintly red, and splash pockets of color here and there along your path. the color begins to crawl out from under its given lamppost and all of the scenery becomes imbued, brushed in a singular hue of translucent rouge. suddenly, you\u2019re startled by a gruff voice from behind\u2014oh, a german shepherd, sitting at your feet. he speaks to you in a rhythmic bark ... a rhythmic bark. you awaken to the sound of the alarm clock and the sight of the warm morning sunlight.  it\u2019s not unusual to realize upon awakening that elements of our true physical surroundings have been incorporated into our dreams. though we normally consider sleep to be a time when we are completely cut off from the real world, in fact, there continues to be a flow of input from our sensory systems, which may be fluidly incorporated into a dream. of course, a strong enough stimulus would lead to an awakening, a fact that most of us take for granted when relying on an alarm clock.  research on external incorporation into dreams has explored the influences of several different sensory systems, including touch, sight, and smell, on our nightly creations. tactile experiments show that both pressure and temperature can influence the content of a dream. in a study conducted by nielsen (1993), participants wore a pressure cuff on their leg while sleeping in the laboratory. during rem sleep, experimenters inflated the cuff to produce pressure on the leg and subsequently awoke participants for dream reports. the authors found several examples of leg pressure incorporated into dreams, sometimes in a subtle yet direct fashion (ie, tingling in the leg), and sometimes in a more elaborate fashion (ie, a dream sequence that involved paralysis of the leg, attempts to move the leg resulting in intense discomfort). thus the physical sensation of pressure on the leg was incorporated in idiosyncratic ways, perhaps depending on the prior narrative of the dream or the quality of sleep.  in another niche of the dream field, researchers have made use of sensory stimuli as a tool for increasing lucidity. many of the sleep masks marketed for lucid dreaming rely on blinking red lights that flash during rem sleep; these red lights appear within the dream, and clue the dreamer into the fact that they are actually sleeping. successful users report seeing flashes of light in their dreams, for example \u201ci was walking along a road with my boss and the whole scene flashed, cueing me that i was dreaming. i mentioned it to him, and flew a little to prove it\u201d (subject dream report in laberge & levitan, 1995). in this case, the users rely on a premeditated cue to trigger lucidity. conceivably, other sensory signals, such as the pressure cuff, could similarly be used to induce lucid dreams.  one important question is just how much sensory stimuli is able to pierce through the barrier of sleep and into your dreams. probably there are variations in sensitivity, similar to waking experience, where certain individuals are more aware of sensory quality and bodily sensation than others. an original project by elizaveta solomonova will explore sensory incorporations in the dreams of vipassana meditators, a technique that focuses on awareness of body sensations. funded by mind and life institute, this project may reveal whether body-oriented contemplative practice alters embodied experience in dreams. in all cases, the impact of sensory stimuli on dreams suggests that the creation of dreams occurs as much in the body as it does in the mind, and underlines the role of the body in conscious experience.",

shall hinder our success, my bank, with parchment scrolls, shall make all plain, ownership affirmed, before the funds progress, to your account, where not a doubt shall remain. years spent in banking,

    "old_belief": "emotional connection, in the context of dreams, refers to the strong link between our emotional state during waking hours and the emotional content of our dreams. dreams are often seen as a reflection of our unconscious mind, and they can process and resolve emotional conflicts experienced during the day. for example, if someone is experiencing fear or anxiety during the day, these emotions may be prominent in their dreams.  here's a more detailed explanation: 1. dreams as a reflection of emotions: dreams are not just random images; they are often linked to our emotional experiences.  emotions experienced during the day can manifest in dreams, either directly or symbolically.  for instance, if someone has been feeling sad or stressed, their dreams might reflect those emotions.  2. dreams and emotional regulation: some studies suggest that dreams, particularly those in rem sleep, play a role in processing and resolving emotional conflicts.  emotionally intense dreams may help individuals process and integrate difficult feelings, potentially leading to improved moods the next day.  dreams can also be a way to work through unresolved emotions and gain insights into our inner world.  3. examples of emotional connections in dreams: fear and anxiety: dreams might feature scenarios involving danger, loss, or overwhelming situations, reflecting feelings of anxiety or fear. sadness and loss: dreams may involve themes of separation, grief, or loss, mirroring emotional pain or sadness. anger and frustration: dreams could feature confrontations, arguments, or acts of aggression, reflecting feelings of anger or frustration.  4. how to interpret emotional dreams: pay attention to the overall emotional tone of your dreams. consider the symbols and imagery in your dreams, as they can be metaphors for deeper emotions. reflect on your waking life and any events that might be contributing to the emotions you are experiencing in your dreams.",

    "old_belief": "from shores of ancient bosphorus i write they appear in my inbox regularly, a couple times a year. i've grown accustomed to these clumsy, google-translated attempts at fraud and long stopped bothering to read them. but this time, when another message arrived via facebook, i noticed something unusual\u2014it was written, inexplicably, in turkish. the instantly translated text\u2014no longer via google\u2014clearly bore the hallmarks of neural network craftsmanship. admittedly, it handles language with far more diligence than i do. plus, turkey\u2014a pleasant geographical change of pace. better than yet another message from nigeria.  and then i remembered my favorite stanis\u0142aw lem novel\u2014the investigation. in one episode, ion tichy amuses himself by making digital copies of consciousnesses\u2014bertrand russell's, someone else's, and shakespeare's, i think\u2014chat with each other. my heart leaped with excitement. what had been pure science fiction in my parents' time had finally come to pass.  just the other day, i even got a call from a recruiter offering me a job as an analyst. the role involved listening to dialogues between two neural networks about some topic or another\u2014and trying to figure out why their conversation veered in whatever direction it did. to dispel my suspicions that he\u2014this recruiter\u2014might himself be a program, he brought up some recent news item, declaring that since he could discuss it, he couldn\u2019t possibly be a bot. i confirmed that i believed he was human, given that his argument was obviously complete nonsense. still, a lingering doubt remained\u2014and, i\u2019ll admit, a sliver of suspicion gnaws at me to this day.  so now, staring at this dm from a supposed turkish bank employee\u2014something distinctly alive and even willing to engage in dialogue\u2014i decided the time had finally come to act and, like ion tichy, to plug something in somewhere, dump data into some system, lean back in my chair, and enjoy the results in the style of john keats, mostly byron, and\u2014for the grand finale\u2014shakespeare. just like in lem's novel.  mahadi hasan:  from shores of ancient bosphorus i write, mahadi hasan fysun my name, a banker, destiny's guide. a tale i spin, of fortune's fading light, and kindred souls, across the world's wide tide.  adrian polski, of your land, now gone, in istanbul, his golden trade he plied. nine million dollars, sleeping, till the dawn, deposited here, before his spirit sighed.  no kin he claimed, no loving hand to hold, alone he passed, by cruel pandemic's sting. my bank knows not, their records yet unfold, a slumbering treasure, ripe for harvesting.  our names, dear george, a whispered symphony, a chance encounter, woven by the fates. i offer partnership, transparently, to claim this prize, before it dissipates.  half shall be yours, a noble, rightful share, legal protection, from all harm and fear. let silence shroud us, as we take our share, respond with haste, my friend, the hour is near.  george polskiy:  that fate divine arranged our meeting, i have doubt, though strange and wondrous paths our lives may tread. a banker from the bosporus, devout, with tales of gold a long-dead soul has shed. nine million dollars, quite a hefty clout, unclaimed, forgotten, like a dream misled. you seek a partner, honest, just, and true, to share the spoils, a fifty-fifty view.  alas, dear madam, your proposal grand, while tempting fate with promises untold, falls flat upon this barren, weary land. my heart is cold, my pockets lined with mold. i've chased no fortune, joined no greedy band, nor traded virtue for a *** of gold. seek elsewhere, friend, for gullible kin. mahadi hasan, go to hell, i mean.  mahadi hasan:  fear not, dear friend, i mean no treachery, my documents attest, this deal is pure and true, a transparent pact, beneath an open sky, and trust, the bridge we must together accrue. though many share your name, my heart can spy, a noble spirit, one who sees this through. this fortune, like a blessing, will descend, upon our houses, guided by my hand.  no legal labyrinth shall hinder our success, my bank, with parchment scrolls, shall make all plain, ownership affirmed, before the funds progress, to your account, where not a doubt shall remain. years spent in banking, grant me this finesse, the rules and systems, i perceive their grain. so trust my counsel, let no worry impede, the bond we forge, where mutual trust we breed.  george polskiy:  you claim no fraud, dear madam, 'tis your plea, with documents galore, all legal and bright. transparency, you say, our guide and glee, an umbrella of trust, to banish the night. my name is common, true, but you chose me, guided by instinct, a beacon of light. your trust i'll not disrupt, a soul so grand, this windfall's blessing, for yours and my hand.  but legal bridges, you say, hold no fright, a banker seasoned, with wisdom profound. their rules and regulations he wields tight, no cause for worry on a solid ground. yet trust, you see, is a fragile light, and promises whispered, is a hollow sound. so keep your millions and documents well, i will not sleep with devil. go to hell.  conclusion:  hark, facebook stranger, lend thine eery ear, to this strange tale of greed and cunning art. a banker from the east, with whispers clear, spins webs of deceit, to tear a soul apart.  with honeyed words and promises so grand, she lures her prey, a stranger from afar, with claims of kinship, and a helping hand, to steal a fortune, hidden in a jar.  but he, though tempted by such dazzling prize, sees through her mask, her motives dark and low. he spurns her offer, with a knowing guise, and bids her seek a fool, where shadows grow.  for honesty and virtue hold more worth, than ill-gained riches, stolen from the earth. #ai #scam #lem #turkey #nigeria #investigation #consciousness #science #bot",

    "new_belief": "on august 28, 1963, some 100 years after president abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves, a young man named martin luther king climbed the marble steps of the lincoln memorial in washington, d.c. to describe his vision of america. more than 200,000 people-black and white-came to listen. they came by plane, by car, by bus, by train, and by foot. they came to washington to demand equal rights for black people. and the dream that they heard on the steps of the monument became the dream of a generation.  as far as black americans were concerned, the nation\u2019s response to brown was agonizingly slow, and neither state legislatures nor the congress seemed willing to help their cause along. finally, president john f. kennedy recognized that only a strong civil rights bill would put teeth into the drive to secure equal protection of the laws for african americans. on june 11, 1963, he proposed such a bill to congress, asking for legislation that would provide \u201cthe kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves.\u201d southern representatives in congress managed to block the bill in committee, and civil rights leaders sought some way to build political momentum behind the measure.  a. philip randolph, a labor leader and longtime civil rights activist, called for a massive march on washington to dramatize the issue. he welcomed the participation of white groups as well as black in order to demonstrate the multiracial backing for civil rights. the various elements of the civil rights movement, many of which had been wary of one another, agreed to participate. the national association for the advancement of colored people, the congress of racial equality, the southern christian leadership conference, the student non-violent coordinating committee and the urban league all managed to bury their differences and work together. the leaders even agreed to tone down the rhetoric of some of the more militant activists for the sake of unity, and they worked closely with the kennedy administration, which hoped the march would, in fact, lead to passage of the civil rights bill.  on august 28, 1963, under a nearly cloudless sky, more than 250,000 people, a fifth of them white, gathered near the lincoln memorial in washington to rally for \u201cjobs and freedom.\u201d the roster of speakers included speakers from nearly every segment of society \u2014 labor leaders like walter reuther, clergy, film stars such as sidney poitier and marlon brando and folksingers such as joan baez. each of the speakers was allotted fifteen minutes, but the day belonged to the young and charismatic leader of the southern christian leadership conference.  dr. martin luther king jr. had originally prepared a short and somewhat formal recitation of the sufferings of african americans attempting to realize their freedom in a society chained by discrimination. he was about to sit down when gospel singer mahalia jackson called out, \u201ctell them about your dream, martin! tell them about the dream!\u201d encouraged by shouts from the audience, king drew upon some of his past talks, and the result became the landmark statement of civil rights in america \u2014 a dream of all people, of all races and colors and backgrounds, sharing in an america marked by freedom and democracy.  for further reading: herbert garfinkel, when negroes march: the march on washington\u2026(1969); taylor branch, parting the waters: america in the king years, 1954-1963 (1988); stephen b. oates, let the trumpet sound: the life of martin luther king jr. (1982). \u201ci have a dream\u201d (1963)  i am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  five score years ago, a great american, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the emancipation proclamation. this momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of whithering injustice. it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. but one hundred years later, the colored america is still not free. one hundred years later, the life of the colored american is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.  one hundred years later, the colored american lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. one hundred years later, the colored american is still languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land so we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.  in a sense we have come to our nation\u2019s capital to cash a check. when the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir.  this note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. instead of honoring this sacred obligation, america has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d  but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.  we have also come to his hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now. this is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.  now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.  now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.  now is the time to make justice a reality to all of god\u2019s children.  i would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it\u2019s colored citizens. this sweltering summer of the colored people\u2019s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. those who hope that the colored americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.  there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  we cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person\u2019s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \u201cfor white only.\u201d  we cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote.  no, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  i am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.  you have been the veterans of creative suffering. continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  go back to mississippi, go back to alabama, go back to south carolina go back to georgia, go back to louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.  let us not wallow in the valley of despair. i say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.  i still have a dream. it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream.  i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.  i have a dream that one day out in the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.  i have a dream today.  i have a dream that one day down in alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  i have a dream today.  i have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.  this is our hope. this is the faith that i will go back to the south with. with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.  with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  with this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  this will be the day when all of god\u2019s children will be able to sing with new meaning \u201cmy country \u2019tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee i sing. land where my father\u2019s died, land of the pilgrim\u2019s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!\u201d  and if america is to be a great nation, this must become true. so let freedom ring from the hilltops of new hampshire. let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york.  let freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania.  let freedom ring from the snow-capped rockies of colorado.  let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california.  but not only that, let freedom, ring from stone mountain of georgia.  let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippi and every mountainside.  when we let freedom ring, when we let it

    "source": "on august 28, 1963, some 100 years after president abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves, a young man named martin luther king climbed the marble steps of the lincoln memorial in washington, d.c. to describe his vision of america. more than 200,000 people-black and white-came to listen. they came by plane, by car, by bus, by train, and by foot. they came to washington to demand equal rights for black people. and the dream that they heard on the steps of the monument became the dream of a generation.  as far as black americans were concerned, the nation\u2019s response to brown was agonizingly slow, and neither state legislatures nor the congress seemed willing to help their cause along. finally, president john f. kennedy recognized that only a strong civil rights bill would put teeth into the drive to secure equal protection of the laws for african americans. on june 11, 1963, he proposed such a bill to congress, asking for legislation that would provide \u201cthe kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves.\u201d southern representatives in congress managed to block the bill in committee, and civil rights leaders sought some way to build political momentum behind the measure.  a. philip randolph, a labor leader and longtime civil rights activist, called for a massive march on washington to dramatize the issue. he welcomed the participation of white groups as well as black in order to demonstrate the multiracial backing for civil rights. the various elements of the civil rights movement, many of which had been wary of one another, agreed to participate. the national association for the advancement of colored people, the congress of racial equality, the southern christian leadership conference, the student non-violent coordinating committee and the urban league all managed to bury their differences and work together. the leaders even agreed to tone down the rhetoric of some of the more militant activists for the sake of unity, and they worked closely with the kennedy administration, which hoped the march would, in fact, lead to passage of the civil rights bill.  on august 28, 1963, under a nearly cloudless sky, more than 250,000 people, a fifth of them white, gathered near the lincoln memorial in washington to rally for \u201cjobs and freedom.\u201d the roster of speakers included speakers from nearly every segment of society \u2014 labor leaders like walter reuther, clergy, film stars such as sidney poitier and marlon brando and folksingers such as joan baez. each of the speakers was allotted fifteen minutes, but the day belonged to the young and charismatic leader of the southern christian leadership conference.  dr. martin luther king jr. had originally prepared a short and somewhat formal recitation of the sufferings of african americans attempting to realize their freedom in a society chained by discrimination. he was about to sit down when gospel singer mahalia jackson called out, \u201ctell them about your dream, martin! tell them about the dream!\u201d encouraged by shouts from the audience, king drew upon some of his past talks, and the result became the landmark statement of civil rights in america \u2014 a dream of all people, of all races and colors and backgrounds, sharing in an america marked by freedom and democracy.  for further reading: herbert garfinkel, when negroes march: the march on washington\u2026(1969); taylor branch, parting the waters: america in the king years, 1954-1963 (1988); stephen b. oates, let the trumpet sound: the life of martin luther king jr. (1982). \u201ci have a dream\u201d (1963)  i am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  five score years ago, a great american, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the emancipation proclamation. this momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of whithering injustice. it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. but one hundred years later, the colored america is still not free. one hundred years later, the life of the colored american is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.  one hundred years later, the colored american lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. one hundred years later, the colored american is still languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land so we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.  in a sense we have come to our nation\u2019s capital to cash a check. when the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir.  this note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. instead of honoring this sacred obligation, america has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d  but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.  we have also come to his hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now. this is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.  now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.  now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.  now is the time to make justice a reality to all of god\u2019s children.  i would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it\u2019s colored citizens. this sweltering summer of the colored people\u2019s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. those who hope that the colored americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.  there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  we cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person\u2019s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \u201cfor white only.\u201d  we cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote.  no, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  i am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.  you have been the veterans of creative suffering. continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  go back to mississippi, go back to alabama, go back to south carolina go back to georgia, go back to louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.  let us not wallow in the valley of despair. i say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.  i still have a dream. it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream.  i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.  i have a dream that one day out in the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.  i have a dream today.  i have a dream that one day down in alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  i have a dream today.  i have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.  this is our hope. this is the faith that i will go back to the south with. with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.  with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  with this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  this will be the day when all of god\u2019s children will be able to sing with new meaning \u201cmy country \u2019tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee i sing. land where my father\u2019s died, land of the pilgrim\u2019s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!\u201d  and if america is to be a great nation, this must become true. so let freedom ring from the hilltops of new hampshire. let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york.  let freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania.  let freedom ring from the snow-capped rockies of colorado.  let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california.  but not only that, let freedom, ring from stone mountain of georgia.  let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippi and every mountainside.  when we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of god\u2019s children, black men and white men, jews and gentiles, protestants and catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old spiritual, \u201cfree at last, free at last. thank god almighty, we are free at last.\u201d"

    "old_belief": "does dreaming help us grow yes, dreaming is linked to various aspects of personal growth and development.  here's how dreaming can contribute to growth: 1. emotional processing and regulation: dreams, especially those occurring during rem sleep, may help in processing emotions and experiences. they can offer a safe space to explore difficult emotions, anxieties, and past traumas, potentially leading to emotional healing and greater resilience. research suggests that dreaming can help prioritize emotionally charged memories while diminishing their severity.  2. memory consolidation and cognitive benefits: dreams are linked to improved memory consolidation and potentially the transfer of information from short-term to long-term memory. the brain may use dreaming to sort through information gathered during the day, potentially aiding in problem-solving and cognitive cleanup. dreams may contribute to cognitive development and may reflect our mental abilities and state.  3. self-awareness and insight: dreams can reflect our waking thoughts, concerns, and experiences, offering insights into our subconscious mind. analyzing the symbols and narratives in dreams can provide a unique pathway to self-discovery and deeper understanding of our motivations and desires. dreams may even offer creative inspiration and solutions to problems that elude us during waking hours.  4. threat simulation and adaptive function: some theories propose that dreams, especially those involving threats, may have an evolutionary function, helping us rehearse responses to potential dangers. this \"virtual training\" can potentially enhance our ability to recognize and avoid threats in real life.  5. personal transformation: pursuing our waking dreams, which often emerge from our subconscious and may be reflected in our nighttime dreams, can lead to significant personal transformation and self-discovery. the journey of pursuing goals and aspirations can expand our comfort zones, build resilience, and develop new skills.  important note: while many theories and research suggest the beneficial role of dreams in personal growth, further research is ongoing to fully understand the complex functions of dreaming.",

who am i?\u2019  \u201ci woke in my flat, transported from that distant place. i had to look and make sure it was the 4th. i was a little surprised that it was.  \u201canalysis: my dreams do indeed continue to get more vivid, to the point where they are almost indistinguishable from reality. i was approached last night. this man spoke to me but not with the typical reactive nature that most conversations in dreams consist of. he asked me questions. he asked me an existential question. i don\u2019t know the meaning of this or its significance.\u201d  i closed out of the dream journal and thought on the subject for a while. perhaps my subconscious was just creating more vivid and realistic worlds. i decided to stop dwelling on nonsense and start the day. i looked out the window at the january snow falling to the streets below.  i walked out of the room past the magnetic shielding to continue my work. the capacitors in the nanobots residing in my brain allowed for twenty minutes of operation outside of the magnetic field. every twenty minutes i would take a break and go back into my bedroom\u2019s b-field and recharge. i was working on a solution for that problem.  that work got easier every day. the nanobots increased the connections between my neurons and the artificial electrodes. i was the only person with the means and will to attempt intelligence amplification, and little by little, i was becoming the most intelligent person the planet had ever seen. the computer power of my brain in just the early stages of my development already far surpassed anything anyone had seen.  i was working on a new generation of nanobots that would be powered by the electrolytes in my blood. this would take away my need to be tethered to my flat and the magnetic field inside. i could go back down onto the streets and walk around. i was originally going to use a piezoelectric membrane on the nanobots and pump ultrasound into my brain. but that was before i had my upgraded prefrontal cortex and was able to make electrolyte-powered nanos possible.  \u201ci found him again. i was able to find the same boardwalk. the dreams are getting longer as my computing power increases; it felt like i waited for days on that beach. i\u2019m looking at the data now and yes, it was equivalent to six days. after all that time on the beach he finally approached me from behind, just as he did the first time.  \u201c\u2019are you dreaming?\u2019  \u201cit had been days. i had given up on seeing him again, so the second time caught me off guard as well. i turned around to the voice. \u2018excuse me?\u201d as soon as i saw him i recognized him. he had soft, hazel eyes and brown hair, something i only knew before but could see now. he stood up tall like he was forcing himself to do so, like he was mustering up the courage to talk to a childhood hero and putting on a brave face.  \u201c\u2018you are dreaming aren\u2019t you? you made this?\u201d  \u201c\u2018yes, i think i did. you want to know who you are. so do i. tell me about yourself.\u2019  \u201c\u2018yes sir. i live in that house over there.\u2019 he pointed to a house just beyond the boardwalk. \u2018i like to watch the waves. you\u2019re the only other person that does.\u2019  \u201c\u2018i was waiting for you.\u2019  \u201c\u2018me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018is this the first time you\u2019ve spoken to me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018yes sir. it took me a few days to work up the courage.\u2019 shame seemed to subtly slide across his face as he admitted that.  \u201c\u2018do you have a name?\u2019  \u201c\u2018a name, sir?\u2019  \u201cand then i woke. the bastard wasted too much time working up his courage. again i had to look at the window and make sure it was april 11th. indeed only one night had passed.  \u201canalysis: definite hints of emotions and sentience.\u201d  i got out of bed and readied for the day. it was my biweekly adventure down the tower and into civilization.  the puddles splashed beneath my feet as i walked the two blocks to the store. people snapped pictures of me as i passed them on the sidewalk, but i paid them no mind. being amongst them was as good as interaction for me. i would try to keep my sustenance gathering to as close to twenty minutes as possible. i couldn\u2019t afford to lose any time on my progress. rather, i didn\u2019t want to. i made it quick and grabbed the essentials. whatever i missed could be acquired by an assistant and brought to the top of the tower.  \u201cas i progress, the dreams are more frequently playing like simulations that i observe rather than participate in. they are still impossibly long. i watched a family live their lives for years last night. the dreams appear to be growing by a few percentage points per day as the nanobots increase the neurological connections.  \u201cthis brings in to question the ethics of my undertaking in to amplified intelligence. these beings in my dreams are clearly sentient, albeit simple, creatures. they question their existence and meaning. when i wake, their simulation ceases, and with it so does their existence. i give them life and then take it away.  \u201cbut all in all, they are an annoying byproduct of my goals. they would have no existence at all without me. i shall have no more empathy for them.  \u201cas electrolyte-powered nanobots near printing, i am ready to integrate the bascs supercomputer system into my nervous system. coupling my brain with bascs will give me an astronomical amount of computing power. i don\u2019t know what life will be like after.\u201d  time is irrelevant there is only information.  \u201ci have awoken for the first time since being coupled with the bascs. much like before, my dreams ran like simulations, but this time on massive proportions. the shear amount of data collected has been enormous. i have run a simulation of an entire universe, although much simpler than the one we live in.  \u201cthe simulation began with an instant introduction of space and energy. quite literally astronomical amounts of space and energy. energy condensed into particles, particles condensed into atoms, atoms condensed into galaxies filled with star systems.  \u201ci believe my subconscious guided the simulation. the reason i believe this is because life only formed in one of these countless star systems, and, as it evolved, many of the species that arose exist here in the real world. including us. they were by far the most fascinating things to come out of this simulation, this dream.  \u201cwhole civilizations arose. they were self-questioning, inquisitive, inventive. they called themselves man, human, or homo sapiens and their planet on which they lived earth. i could interact with them, but i enjoyed observing from afar.  \u201cthey discovered much about their universe. even to the point where their instruments could see to smaller levels than my simulation\u2019s physics could allow for. their work was admirable but now i am awake, and they are nothing.\u201d  i stood up and walked out of the b-field into the lab. i deleted the plans for the electrolyte nanobots waiting to be printed. and watched the first snow of the winter fall onto the streets below.",

you made this?\u201d  \u201c\u2018yes, i think i did. you want to know who you are. so do i. tell me about yourself.\u2019  \u201c\u2018yes sir. i live in that house over there.\u2019 he pointed to a house just beyond the boardwalk. \u2018i like to watch the waves. you\u2019re the only other person that does.\u2019  \u201c\u2018i was waiting for you.\u2019  \u201c\u2018me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018is this the first time you\u2019ve spoken to me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018yes sir. it took me a few days to work up the courage.\u2019 shame seemed to subtly slide across his face as he admitted that.  \u201c\u2018do you have a name?\u2019  \u201c\u2018a name, sir?\u2019  \u201cand then i woke. the bastard wasted too much time working up his courage. again i had to look at the window and make sure it was april 11th. indeed only one night had passed.  \u201canalysis: definite hints of emotions and sentience.\u201d  i got out of bed and readied for the day. it was my biweekly adventure down the tower and into civilization.  the puddles splashed beneath my feet as i walked the two blocks to the store. people snapped pictures of me as i passed them on the sidewalk, but i paid them no mind. being amongst them was as good as interaction for me. i would try to keep my sustenance gathering to as close to twenty minutes as possible. i couldn\u2019t afford to lose any time on my progress. rather, i didn\u2019t want to. i made it quick and grabbed the essentials. whatever i missed could be acquired by an assistant and brought to the top of the tower.  \u201cas i progress, the dreams are more frequently playing like simulations that i observe rather than participate in. they are still impossibly long. i watched a family live their lives for years last night. the dreams appear to be growing by a few percentage points per day as the nanobots increase the neurological connections.  \u201cthis brings in to question the ethics of my undertaking in to amplified intelligence. these beings in my dreams are clearly sentient, albeit simple, creatures. they question their existence and meaning. when i wake, their simulation ceases, and with it so does their existence. i give them life and then take it away.  \u201cbut all in all, they are an annoying byproduct of my goals. they would have no existence at all without me. i shall have no more empathy for them.  \u201cas electrolyte-powered nanobots near printing, i am ready to integrate the bascs supercomputer system into my nervous system. coupling my brain with bascs will give me an astronomical amount of computing power. i don\u2019t know what life will be like after.\u201d  time is irrelevant there is only information.  \u201ci have awoken for the first time since being coupled with the bascs. much like before, my dreams ran like simulations, but this time on massive proportions. the shear amount of data collected has been enormous. i have run a simulation of an entire universe, although much simpler than the one we live in.  \u201cthe simulation began with an instant introduction of space and energy. quite literally astronomical amounts of space and energy. energy condensed into particles, particles condensed into atoms, atoms condensed into galaxies filled with star systems.  \u201ci believe my subconscious guided the simulation. the reason i believe this is because life only formed in one of these countless star systems, and, as it evolved, many of the species that arose exist here in the real world. including us. they were by far the most fascinating things to come out of this simulation, this dream.  \u201cwhole civilizations arose. they were self-questioning, inquisitive, inventive. they called themselves man, human, or homo sapiens and their planet on which they lived earth. i could interact with them, but i enjoyed observing from afar.  \u201cthey discovered much about their universe. even to the point where their instruments could see to smaller levels than my simulation\u2019s physics could allow for. their work was admirable but now i am awake, and they are nothing.\u201d  i stood up and walked out of the b-field into the lab. i deleted the plans for the electrolyte nanobots waiting to be printed. and watched the first snow of the winter fall onto the streets below."

    "old_belief": "wonder, also known as the central feature of the human spirit, is a heightened state of consciousness and emotion brought about by something unexpected (konner, 2002). wonder is the launching pad for creativity, resilience, and connection. it can be experienced as a joy-filled amazement at life and allows one to receive uncertainty with openness (davis, 2021). this splendor that unexpectedly prompts you to take charge of the next beautiful phase of life has the potential to overcome barriers, and finesse challenges in pursuit of one\u2019s aims (davis, 2021). one of the qualities of wonder, compared to awe, is that it can sneak into the creases and cracks of everyday life.       \u201cwonder is the first of all the passions\u201d \u2013 ren\u00e9 descartes      in today\u2019s world, it seems that everyone is consumed with work, meeting deadlines, running errands, commuting, sitting in traffic, or waiting in line. add to that the amount of time spent in front of screens. not to mention the amount of time spent mentally elsewhere \u2013 worrying, ruminating, planning, or dwelling on things \u2013 and not living in the present moment. society oftentimes glorifies the \u201cworkaholic\u201d lifestyle, always being busy and working on something. however, how beneficial is this busy, monotonous lifestyle? society has seen a general decrease in live-event attendance, a decrease in funding within schools for both music and the arts, a decrease in time spent outdoors in nature, a decrease in attention spans, an increase in materialism, and a decrease in connection than in prior generations (paquette, 2020). luckily, all is not lost with these changes in our wonder-deprived society. the unique capacity to experience wonder is one of our defining traits as human beings and is something that enabled our survival and endurance as a species (paquette, 2020). experiencing wonder is something that can be natural if you open your mind to it.     there are many benefits to experiencing wonder. some of the main findings suggest that wonder provides a launchpad for creativity, resilience, and connection (davis, 2021). also, wonder appears to increase life satisfaction, reduce stress levels, make people less materialistic, make people more humble, and give people an expanded sense of time (joye, y. & bolderdijk, j. w., 2015; paquette, 2020). all these benefits can help you to become more grounded in your everyday life and enjoy the world\u2019s magnificence \u2013 even in things that to the naked eye can be confused as irrelevant or unimportant.       \u201cwonder is a portal of consciousness that lets us see again what is beautiful and real, true and possible.\u201d   \u2013 jeffery davis      there are many ways to incorporate more wonder into your everyday life, but an easy way is to explore one of the facets of wonder: openness. being open to life\u2019s mysteries and new possibilities can be correlated with creativity. a renowned psychologist with revolutionary findings on flow noted that creative people tend to be smart and na\u00efve at the same time (csikszentmihalyi, 1996). csikszentmihalyi found that intellectual intelligence beyond a base-level competency neither correlates with high creative output nor with a fulfilled life. so, to live a fulfilled life, you do not have to be the most intelligent or the best at something; rather, you just need to be open to new experiences and embrace the naiveness in you. the german poet goethe once wrote that \u201cnaivet\u00e9 is the most important attribute for genius.\u201d this idea can help us to remember that there is an inner force of genius within everyone. thus, your openness to experiences can be a greater predictor of your ability to find creative solutions to problems than intellect (davis, 2021). now that we\u2019ve discussed the usefulness behind the facet of openness, here are some practices to help you experience wonder in your daily life.",

    "old_belief": "\u201c\u2018are you dreaming?\u2019  \u201cthe question caught me off guard. i didn\u2019t recognize the voice. i turned to look at the man that questioned me. \u2018excuse me?\u2019 as i turned i realized i wasn\u2019t able to focus on the man\u2019s face, but i knew it was there. i knew what it looked like, too, even though i couldn\u2019t make it out.  \u201che spoke to me again. \u2018you are dreaming aren\u2019t you? you made this?\u2019 he looked around at the boardwalk we were standing on. people walked passed us, unconcerned with our conversation.  \u201ci took a second to think about his question this time. i couldn\u2019t tell you what i was thinking about before he came up to me and, now that he brought it up, there was a certain oddness to the day. i looked down at the railing i was leaning on and felt it. the wood was old and rough, splintering beneath my fingers as i ran them slowly over it. this was too real to be a dream.  \u201ci looked back at the man. \u2018why do you ask?\u2019  \u201c\u2018you were the only one looking at the waves.\u2019 i turned back to the beach. nobody was on it. the man took a step toward me. \u2018sir? who am i?\u2019  \u201ci woke in my flat, transported from that distant place. i had to look and make sure it was the 4th. i was a little surprised that it was.  \u201canalysis: my dreams do indeed continue to get more vivid, to the point where they are almost indistinguishable from reality. i was approached last night. this man spoke to me but not with the typical reactive nature that most conversations in dreams consist of. he asked me questions. he asked me an existential question. i don\u2019t know the meaning of this or its significance.\u201d  i closed out of the dream journal and thought on the subject for a while. perhaps my subconscious was just creating more vivid and realistic worlds. i decided to stop dwelling on nonsense and start the day. i looked out the window at the january snow falling to the streets below.  i walked out of the room past the magnetic shielding to continue my work. the capacitors in the nanobots residing in my brain allowed for twenty minutes of operation outside of the magnetic field. every twenty minutes i would take a break and go back into my bedroom\u2019s b-field and recharge. i was working on a solution for that problem.  that work got easier every day. the nanobots increased the connections between my neurons and the artificial electrodes. i was the only person with the means and will to attempt intelligence amplification, and little by little, i was becoming the most intelligent person the planet had ever seen. the computer power of my brain in just the early stages of my development already far surpassed anything anyone had seen.  i was working on a new generation of nanobots that would be powered by the electrolytes in my blood. this would take away my need to be tethered to my flat and the magnetic field inside. i could go back down onto the streets and walk around. i was originally going to use a piezoelectric membrane on the nanobots and pump ultrasound into my brain. but that was before i had my upgraded prefrontal cortex and was able to make electrolyte-powered nanos possible.  \u201ci found him again. i was able to find the same boardwalk. the dreams are getting longer as my computing power increases; it felt like i waited for days on that beach. i\u2019m looking at the data now and yes, it was equivalent to six days. after all that time on the beach he finally approached me from behind, just as he did the first time.  \u201c\u2019are you dreaming?\u2019  \u201cit had been days. i had given up on seeing him again, so the second time caught me off guard as well. i turned around to the voice. \u2018excuse me?\u201d as soon as i saw him i recognized him. he had soft, hazel eyes and brown hair, something i only knew before but could see now. he stood up tall like he was forcing himself to do so, like he was mustering up the courage to talk to a childhood hero and putting on a brave face.  \u201c\u2018you are dreaming aren\u2019t you? you made this?\u201d  \u201c\u2018yes, i think i did. you want to know who you are. so do i. tell me about yourself.\u2019  \u201c\u2018yes sir. i live in that house over there.\u2019 he pointed to a house just beyond the boardwalk. \u2018i like to watch the waves. you\u2019re the only other person that does.\u2019  \u201c\u2018i was waiting for you.\u2019  \u201c\u2018me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018is this the first time you\u2019ve spoken to me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018yes sir. it took me a few days to work up the courage.\u2019 shame seemed to subtly slide across his face as he admitted that.  \u201c\u2018do you have a name?\u2019  \u201c\u2018a name, sir?\u2019  \u201cand then i woke. the bastard wasted too much time working up his courage. again i had to look at the window and make sure it was april 11th. indeed only one night had passed.  \u201canalysis: definite hints of emotions and sentience.\u201d  i got out of bed and readied for the day. it was my biweekly adventure down the tower and into civilization.  the puddles splashed beneath my feet as i walked the two blocks to the store. people snapped pictures of me as i passed them on the sidewalk, but i paid them no mind. being amongst them was as good as interaction for me. i would try to keep my sustenance gathering to as close to twenty minutes as possible. i couldn\u2019t afford to lose any time on my progress. rather, i didn\u2019t want to. i made it quick and grabbed the essentials. whatever i missed could be acquired by an assistant and brought to the top of the tower.  \u201cas i progress, the dreams are more frequently playing like simulations that i observe rather than participate in. they are still impossibly long. i watched a family live their lives for years last night. the dreams appear to be growing by a few percentage points per day as the nanobots increase the neurological connections.  \u201cthis brings in to question the ethics of my undertaking in to amplified intelligence. these beings in my dreams are clearly sentient, albeit simple, creatures. they question their existence and meaning. when i wake, their simulation ceases, and with it so does their existence. i give them life and then take it away.  \u201cbut all in all, they are an annoying byproduct of my goals. they would have no existence at all without me. i shall have no more empathy for them.  \u201cas electrolyte-powered nanobots near printing, i am ready to integrate the bascs supercomputer system into my nervous system. coupling my brain with bascs will give me an astronomical amount of computing power. i don\u2019t know what life will be like after.\u201d  time is irrelevant there is only information.  \u201ci have awoken for the first time since being coupled with the bascs. much like before, my dreams ran like simulations, but this time on massive proportions. the shear amount of data collected has been enormous. i have run a simulation of an entire universe, although much simpler than the one we live in.  \u201cthe simulation began with an instant introduction of space and energy. quite literally astronomical amounts of space and energy. energy condensed into particles, particles condensed into atoms, atoms condensed into galaxies filled with star systems.  \u201ci believe my subconscious guided the simulation. the reason i believe this is because life only formed in one of these countless star systems, and, as it evolved, many of the species that arose exist here in the real world. including us. they were by far the most fascinating things to come out of this simulation, this dream.  \u201cwhole civilizations arose. they were self-questioning, inquisitive, inventive. they called themselves man, human, or homo sapiens and their planet on which they lived earth. i could interact with them, but i enjoyed observing from afar.  \u201cthey discovered much about their universe. even to the point where their instruments could see to smaller levels than my simulation\u2019s physics could allow for. their work was admirable but now i am awake, and they are nothing.\u201d  i stood up and walked out of the b-field into the lab. i deleted the plans for the electrolyte nanobots waiting to be printed. and watched the first snow of the winter fall onto the streets below.",

    "old_belief": "this rhyming poem is the spark that can reignite the fires within you. it challenges you to go out and live your life in the present moment as a \u201chero\u201d and leave your mark on this world. \u201ca psalm of life\u201d by henry wadsworth longfellow describes the purpose of life, and how one should handle the sorrow and struggles along the way. throughout the poem, he intends to encourage the readers and urges them not to let the precious moments of life go in vain. he instructs them to keep a balance between happiness and sorrows and carve a better future for themselves. we should not spend our priceless moments sitting idly and doing nothing, rather we have to work hard towards reaching our goal and to make the most out of this short life.  act! take action! be active!  tell me not, in mournful numbers,  life is but an empty dream!  for the soul is dead that slumbers,  and things are not what they seem.  life is real! life is earnest!  and the grave is not its goal;  dust thou art, to dust returnest,  was not spoken of the soul.  not enjoyment, and not sorrow,  is our destined end or way;  but to act, that each to-morrow  find us farther than to-day.  art is long, and time is fleeting,  and our hearts, though stout and brave,  still, like muffled drums, are beating  funeral marches to the grave.  in the world\u2019s broad field of battle,  in the bivouac of life,  be not like dumb, driven cattle!  be a hero in the strife!  trust no future, however pleasant!  let the dead past bury its dead!  act, \u2014 act in the living present!  heart within, and god o\u2019erhead!  lives of great men all remind us  we can make our lives sublime,  and, departing, leave behind us  footprints on the sands of time;  footprints, that perhaps another,  sailing o\u2019er life\u2019s solemn main,  a forlorn and shipwrecked brother,  seeing shall take heart again.  let us, then, be up and doing,  with a heart for any fate;  still achieving, still pursuing,  learn to labor and to wait.",

she once asked sarcastically.\u00a0how about a drone that we can use transport food from the fridge up to the treehouse, huh? wouldn't that be neat?\u00a0 when we were kids, i would give her piggyback rides and we\u2019d run through the sprinklers across watery arches with captured rainbows. we'd go back home, and my mother would scold us while our shivering bodies shared a single towel, and in the end, she'd shine me a blue-lipped smile with her crooked teeth. that was fun, wasn't it?\u00a0\u00a0 our childhood adventures involved trips to the public pool, wet t-shirts, and popsicles mucking up our fingers under the august sun. she'd take me to her soccer team's practices, and i'd watch her run up and down while i built rovers and complex constructs out of legos on the bleachers. booyah!\u00a0she'd shout after scoring a goal. i'd cheer or clap, and she would always gleam and say the same thing.\u00a0goooooooaaaaallllll. and that's how the west was won. a few years later, our tastes matured, slipping our summers into memories and substituting them for funky clothing and car rides on the empty freeway. she and i would stop on the roadsides by green fields that looked blue under the night sky. we'd sit under the blanket of stars and watch the moon while dreaming up our futures after high school.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm going to apply for a sports scholarship and get the fuck out of this town,\u00a0she'd always say.\u00a0how about you? i don't know.\u00a0i shrugged.\u00a0maybe i'll go work with my dad as an apprentice at his accounting firm. what? come on, you got to apply for university too. you're a freakin brainiac. i'm sure you could get into any school. out the bay window, i see the lunar triplets:\u00a0euphrosyne, aglia,\u00a0and\u00a0nathalia\u00a0dancing around what the new worlds association likes to call\u00a0undine, the flooded, blue planet, equivalent in size to jupiter, that i've been studying for what would be measured, on planet earth, as eight months.\u00a0 the journey to this specific star system took four years. the rest of the crew and i have enough resources to last another sixteen\u00a0earth\u00a0months. by then, we'll have made a substantial dent in our research. our food, water, fuel, along with our tolerance for the presence of one another, will have depleted, and we'll go into cryosleep for our return. a decade, that's how long we'll have been apart.\u00a0 so you'll be asleep, frozen in a coffin for about eight years?\u00a0 i assured her that it was completely safe, that i wouldn't die in transport.\u00a0 but doesn't that mean that you'll come back looking almost the same as when you left? won't you technically be younger than me? i think about her current age. how it's already been more than 8 years, and how unfair it must have seemed to her; that she'd miss me in the entirety of all that elapsed time while i'd be sleeping almost all the years away, except for two.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes i wonder if she tells her other friends and customers about me.\u00a0my buddy's up in space,\u00a0i imagine her saying.\u00a0what's he doing up there?

i laughed at her remark.\u00a0i don't know,\u00a0i answered.\u00a0i guess i could teach or go for my ph.d. what? but you just finished school, now you're thinking about going back?\u00a0she commented while scratching her head. she tugged on the bill of her baseball cap and shook her head in disapproval.\u00a0you're nuts, homeboy!\u00a0 yeah? and what do you think i should do? if i were as wicked smart as you, i'd go to the moon! scientists are some of the professionals that, depending on their branch of specialization, are often courted by big-money tech companies and international organizations. she heard about a space program from one of her faithful customers, a man that worked as a research assistant for the state university who always ordered a bear claw with a large cup of coffee and a blt for the road. she told me how the new worlds association was looking for people to\u00a0blast off, in her own words, into space. that the money i'd receive would leave me set for life.\u00a0\u00a0 she was the one that showed me the association's website.\u00a0it says here you have to send them a paper or something explaining your qualifications, along with an idea for a project applicable in space, highlighting a specific area of research. does that sound like something you could do? huh?\u00a0i was distracted at first by the site's banner, a rocket blasting off into the moon, pointing like an arrowhead to the unknown.\u00a0i think so,\u00a0i answered, correcting myself.\u00a0but \u2014 but what if i get accepted? that's what i should have asked.\u00a0but what if they don't think i'm qualified enough? what if i'm rejected? then they're crazy,\u00a0she snapped back.\u00a0you're the most intelligent person i know! no way, they'd reject you.\u00a0 i pitched her my project several times, letting her serve as my judge and jury. the idea was simple, build a compact, remote-operated device that could probe the oceanic planet of\u00a0undine.\u00a0 do you mean like a robotic hand? exactly, think of it like a hand that's also like a drone,\u00a0i said.\u00a0a machine that could enter the planet and try to collect data on whether there are any living organisms present in the planet's aquatic terrain or not. if the scan is positive, it'll extract several samples for me and the crew. some of these samples can undergo analysis and testing while in space, and others could be stored in a controlled environment on the spacecraft and transported back home with us.\u00a0 she stared at me for a few seconds, her eyes wide and her mouth nearly dangling from her jaw like a bell.\u00a0 so...what do you think? i think you're going into space.\u00a0 the admiration in her eyes was stunning and had me gleaming like a young boy.\u00a0who knows, maybe we'll even stop by the moon on our return? the probe,\u00a0michaelangelo, named by myself, will enter\u00a0undine's\u00a0domain in approximately two weeks. from our current distance, the device's descent will take anywhere from two to three days. that's when my mission will reach its zenith and when things could get dicey. i'll have to watch over\u00a0michaelangelo\u00a0as if it's a newborn child learning to swim. i'll also have to frequently analyze\u00a0undine's\u00a0tidal patterns and climate while observing the incoming data as soon as\u00a0michaelangelo\u00a0departs from the spacecraft. do you think michaelangelo will make it out of that place in one piece?\u00a0she asked with a worried expression as if the probe was a living creature, a pet cat or dog. i think so. i'm working with a pretty big budget, and it'll be made exclusively for the mission. knowing you'll be the one to build him, i'm sure he'll be great! no, i'm wrong. michaelangelo\u00a0will be better than great. he'll be fucking perfect.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm glad one of us is feeling confident,\u00a0i returned, leaning back into her sofa. she plopped himself right beside me, threw her arm over my neck, and pulled me into her orbit with such savagery that we ended up rolling onto the floor. she flipped herself over, partially resting her chest over mine,\u00a0don't be so hard on yourself. i believe in you. i'll miss you, you know that, right?\u00a0i gushed. we hadn't talked about the possibility of my leaving, camouflaging the void that would be left behind with excitement and speculation. my eyes at that moment reddened, burned much like they always do whenever i think of her. hey, it'll be a good opportunity for you, won't it? you'll be doing something you're good at, something that could help everyone back here on planet earth.\u00a0\u00a0 onboard the spaceship, there's a mechanic who's responsible for repairs and keeping the ship functioning, who sometimes also gets the chance to soar like an acrobat in the depths of space. we have a medic doing research on the proliferation of diseases under low gravity conditions.\u00a0 they all sound like show-offs, that's what!\u00a0 there's also a physicist and a botanist. our pilot's one of the few men to have traveled multiple times to the moon and mars, as well as a skilled photographer who captured high-definition photos of cosmic dust clouds, and then there's me, a certified scientist, as she'd like to say.\u00a0 a certified scientist who won himself a round trip ticket to space.\u00a0 weeks before my leave, we were lying close to one another in a field of dark-blue grass.\u00a0you're going to do big things up there,\u00a0she said. she turned and shined me her crooked smile.\u00a0and when you're back, everyone is going to know your name.\u00a0 you know i don't care about any of that stuff. i'm much more interested in seeing the planet with the three moons. i swear, love, only you.\u00a0\u00a0 everyone here talks about their projects, comments on how much they miss their family. our captain left his wife three months pregnant back home, our mechanic and our medic, two kids each. when they turn to me and ask if i've left anything important behind, the first person that comes to mind isn't my mother or father, a house or a car; it's her.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm the quiet one up here. space is already deathly silent, but it and i enter into staring contests with each other through the bay window, my eyes versus\u00a0undine's\u00a0three moons. i watch them, the triplets that grace the aquatic planet, drawing up conclusions as to what might occur if one of the lunar bodies were to simply explode. obviously, there'd be no sound, but i'd watch the floating remnants, mesmerized by the rubble as if catching the sight of fallen snow. in this particular star system, aside from all the planets and moons spread out across the field of space, there's also a bright celestial body similar to the sun back home. the lone star is distant from everything, the same way that i'm years away from my planet and from the only person more important to me than anything in the whole universe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how do you think things will be like once i'm back?\u00a0i asked her before i left for my physical and mental training.\u00a0 what do you mean?\u00a0she returned.\u00a0 will we still be \u2014 you're kidding, right? come on, i know you're smarter than that.\u00a0 she hugged me, and for a moment, i wished she had begged me not to go. i considered the idea of staying, of resisting the money, and even the chance to see the moon.\u00a0 promise me you'll be here when i get back. i wouldn't dream of leaving this place without you. i'll be here waiting for you. me, and this planet with nothing but a single moon.\u00a0 at times i question myself.\u00a0what's so great about a planet that's essentially all water and almost no detectable land?\u00a0and i'll hear her saying how we could build floating houses or architectural structures like the maldives, or that we can bring out a boat from earth just like noah's ark and spend our days searching the blue world for a paradisiac island.\u00a0who knows, maybe we could even live in underwater domes like the atlanteans? i'll nod and chuckle to myself and say\u00a0sure\u00a0as if it's all so simple. i'll picture us both on\u00a0undine\u00a0drifting together in its never-ending pool. she and i, in our own private world, where we'll swim in our t-shirts and play with\u00a0michaelangelo.\u00a0 before i left, she gave me an envelope,\u00a0open it only once you're far away from\u00a0earth.\u00a0it's because of what she wrote that i know i'll return, that i'll tell her everything, from what i saw to what i dreamt. i'll say how much i remembered, how much i missed her, and i'll repeat the exact verse she wrote at the end of her letter; three words more significant to me than\u00a0undine\u00a0and its three moons.",

    "old_belief": "20 years in space   she comes to me in pieces as i watch the stillness of space, envisioning new constellations in the array of unrecognized stars. i trace the sparks of light with my finger, connecting the dots and smudging the glass as a result.\u00a0\u00a0 how many stars do you think there are in space?\u00a0i imagine her asking.\u00a0can there really be other ones out there as big as or even bigger than the sun?\u00a0 i always admired her genuine curiosity, how she viewed things with a particular interest, how she saw me. she was the one that organized our sleepovers, the one that nudged me to sign up for afterschool activities such as the chemistry club and the robotics team.\u00a0\u00a0 can you build me a mechanical arm that'll change the channels on the tv's remote, so that way i don't have to? she once asked sarcastically.\u00a0how about a drone that we can use transport food from the fridge up to the treehouse, huh? wouldn't that be neat?\u00a0 when we were kids, i would give her piggyback rides and we\u2019d run through the sprinklers across watery arches with captured rainbows. we'd go back home, and my mother would scold us while our shivering bodies shared a single towel, and in the end, she'd shine me a blue-lipped smile with her crooked teeth. that was fun, wasn't it?\u00a0\u00a0 our childhood adventures involved trips to the public pool, wet t-shirts, and popsicles mucking up our fingers under the august sun. she'd take me to her soccer team's practices, and i'd watch her run up and down while i built rovers and complex constructs out of legos on the bleachers. booyah!\u00a0she'd shout after scoring a goal. i'd cheer or clap, and she would always gleam and say the same thing.\u00a0goooooooaaaaallllll. and that's how the west was won. a few years later, our tastes matured, slipping our summers into memories and substituting them for funky clothing and car rides on the empty freeway. she and i would stop on the roadsides by green fields that looked blue under the night sky. we'd sit under the blanket of stars and watch the moon while dreaming up our futures after high school.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm going to apply for a sports scholarship and get the fuck out of this town,\u00a0she'd always say.\u00a0how about you? i don't know.\u00a0i shrugged.\u00a0maybe i'll go work with my dad as an apprentice at his accounting firm. what? come on, you got to apply for university too. you're a freakin brainiac. i'm sure you could get into any school. out the bay window, i see the lunar triplets:\u00a0euphrosyne, aglia,\u00a0and\u00a0nathalia\u00a0dancing around what the new worlds association likes to call\u00a0undine, the flooded, blue planet, equivalent in size to jupiter, that i've been studying for what would be measured, on planet earth, as eight months.\u00a0 the journey to this specific star system took four years. the rest of the crew and i have enough resources to last another sixteen\u00a0earth\u00a0months. by then, we'll have made a substantial dent in our research. our food, water, fuel, along with our tolerance for the presence of one another, will have depleted, and we'll go into cryosleep for our return. a decade, that's how long we'll have been apart.\u00a0 so you'll be asleep, frozen in a coffin for about eight years?\u00a0 i assured her that it was completely safe, that i wouldn't die in transport.\u00a0 but doesn't that mean that you'll come back looking almost the same as when you left? won't you technically be younger than me? i think about her current age. how it's already been more than 8 years, and how unfair it must have seemed to her; that she'd miss me in the entirety of all that elapsed time while i'd be sleeping almost all the years away, except for two.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes i wonder if she tells her other friends and customers about me.\u00a0my buddy's up in space,\u00a0i imagine her saying.\u00a0what's he doing up there? he's researching a new planet, someplace better than this shit hole we're destroying.\u00a0 undine\u00a0registers an oxygen signature similar to europa and planet earth. the oceanic surface covering the entire planet could host a form of phytoplankton or an entirely new plant species capable of producing oxygen as a byproduct of their natural photosynthetic process. in other words,\u00a0undine\u00a0could, in theory, host life.\u00a0 if i'm being honest with myself, sometimes i feel that my role on this ship isn't as relevant as the other crew members' works. that perhaps what i'm doing isn't as impacting, that it's less exciting. i'm not spacewalking or trying to merge chemical compounds under zero-gravity conditions. i barely passed the physical exam, and my score on the simulatory emergency program ranked me as the fifth in command if anything were to happen to our pilot or the others of my crew.\u00a0\u00a0 so what?\u00a0she'd fire out.\u00a0you'll still be one of the few guys part of the human race to have ever gone up to space. you'll still have broken records, be mentioned in the history books. you'll have gone places no one has ever been to.\u00a0 \u00a0 it was always like her to see the bright side in situations. when she didn't get her full-ride to college, she applied for the town's undergrad program at the local college.\u00a0don't worry, hun, i'm still going to make it back and get myself out of this place. when she couldn't juggle both her academic life and work to help her folks pay the bills, she still didn't crumble under all the pressure.\u00a0i'll take a break this semester, and then on the next one, i'll go back.\u00a0 she never returned to school to finish her undergrad.\u00a0maybe college just isn't for me.\u00a0she opted to continue working, helping out her folks, and eventually went to, and finished, trade school.\u00a0i'm thinking about opening a restaurant.\u00a0she told me years ago.\u00a0what about you, what are you thinking about doing with your life, huh, mr. big shot imma certified scientist? i laughed at her remark.\u00a0i don't know,\u00a0i answered.\u00a0i guess i could teach or go for my ph.d. what? but you just finished school, now you're thinking about going back?\u00a0she commented while scratching her head. she tugged on the bill of her baseball cap and shook her head in disapproval.\u00a0you're nuts, homeboy!\u00a0 yeah? and what do you think i should do? if i were as wicked smart as you, i'd go to the moon! scientists are some of the professionals that, depending on their branch of specialization, are often courted by big-money tech companies and international organizations. she heard about a space program from one of her faithful customers, a man that worked as a research assistant for the state university who always ordered a bear claw with a large cup of coffee and a blt for the road. she told me how the new worlds association was looking for people to\u00a0blast off, in her own words, into space. that the money i'd receive would leave me set for life.\u00a0\u00a0 she was the one that showed me the association's website.\u00a0it says here you have to send them a paper or something explaining your qualifications, along with an idea for a project applicable in space, highlighting a specific area of research. does that sound like something you could do? huh?\u00a0i was distracted at first by the site's banner, a rocket blasting off into the moon, pointing like an arrowhead to the unknown.\u00a0i think so,\u00a0i answered, correcting myself.\u00a0but \u2014 but what if i get accepted? that's what i should have asked.\u00a0but what if they don't think i'm qualified enough? what if i'm rejected? then they're crazy,\u00a0she snapped back.\u00a0you're the most intelligent person i know! no way, they'd reject you.\u00a0 i pitched her my project several times, letting her serve as my judge and jury. the idea was simple, build a compact, remote-operated device that could probe the oceanic planet of\u00a0undine.\u00a0 do you mean like a robotic hand? exactly, think of it like a hand that's also like a drone,\u00a0i said.\u00a0a machine that could enter the planet and try to collect data on whether there are any living organisms present in the planet's aquatic terrain or not. if the scan is positive, it'll extract several samples for me and the crew. some of these samples can undergo analysis and testing while in space, and others could be stored in a controlled environment on the spacecraft and transported back home with us.\u00a0 she stared at me for a few seconds, her eyes wide and her mouth nearly dangling from her jaw like a bell.\u00a0 so...what do you think? i think you're going into space.\u00a0 the admiration in her eyes was stunning and had me gleaming like a young boy.\u00a0who knows, maybe we'll even stop by the moon on our return? the probe,\u00a0michaelangelo, named by myself, will enter\u00a0undine's\u00a0domain in approximately two weeks. from our current distance, the device's descent will take anywhere from two to three days. that's when my mission will reach its zenith and when things could get dicey. i'll have to watch over\u00a0michaelangelo\u00a0as if it's a newborn child learning to swim. i'll also have to frequently analyze\u00a0undine's\u00a0tidal patterns and climate while observing the incoming data as soon as\u00a0michaelangelo\u00a0departs from the spacecraft. do you think michaelangelo will make it out of that place in one piece?\u00a0she asked with a worried expression as if the probe was a living creature, a pet cat or dog. i think so. i'm working with a pretty big budget, and it'll be made exclusively for the mission. knowing you'll be the one to build him, i'm sure he'll be great! no, i'm wrong. michaelangelo\u00a0will be better than great. he'll be fucking perfect.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm glad one of us is feeling confident,\u00a0i returned, leaning back into her sofa. she plopped himself right beside me, threw her arm over my neck, and pulled me into her orbit with such savagery that we ended up rolling onto the floor. she flipped herself over, partially resting her chest over mine,\u00a0don't be so hard on yourself. i believe in you. i'll miss you, you know that, right?\u00a0i gushed. we hadn't talked about the possibility of my leaving, camouflaging the void that would be left behind with excitement and speculation. my eyes at that moment reddened, burned much like they always do whenever i think of her. hey, it'll be a good opportunity for you, won't it? you'll be doing something you're good at, something that could help everyone back here on planet earth.\u00a0\u00a0 onboard the spaceship, there's a mechanic who's responsible for repairs and keeping the ship functioning, who sometimes also gets the chance to soar like an acrobat in the depths of space. we have a medic doing research on the proliferation of diseases under low gravity conditions.\u00a0 they all sound like show-offs, that's what!\u00a0 there's also a physicist and a botanist. our pilot's one of the few men to have traveled multiple times to the moon and mars, as well as a skilled photographer who captured high-definition photos of cosmic dust clouds, and then there's me, a certified scientist, as she'd like to say.\u00a0 a certified scientist who won himself a round trip ticket to space.\u00a0 weeks before my leave, we were lying close to one another in a field of dark-blue grass.\u00a0you're going to do big things up there,\u00a0she said. she turned and shined me her crooked smile.\u00a0and when you're back, everyone is going to know your name.\u00a0 you know i don't care about any of that stuff. i'm much more interested in seeing the planet with the three moons. i swear, love, only you.\u00a0\u00a0 everyone here talks about their projects, comments on how much they miss their family. our captain left his wife three months pregnant back home, our mechanic and our medic, two kids each. when they turn to me and ask if i've left anything important behind, the first person that comes to mind isn't my mother or father, a house or a car; it's her.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm the quiet one up here. space is already deathly silent, but it and i enter into staring contests with each other through the bay window, my eyes versus\u00a0undine's\u00a0three moons. i watch them, the triplets that grace the aquatic planet, drawing up conclusions as to what might occur if one of the lunar bodies were to simply explode. obviously, there'd be no sound, but i'd watch the floating remnants, mesmerized by the rubble as if catching the sight of fallen snow. in this particular star system, aside from all the planets and moons spread out across the field of space, there's also a bright celestial body similar to the sun back home. the lone star is distant from everything, the same way that i'm years away from my planet and from the only person more important to me than anything in the whole universe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how do you think things will be like once i'm back?\u00a0i asked her before i left for my physical and mental training.\u00a0 what do you mean?\u00a0she returned.\u00a0 will we still be \u2014 you're kidding, right? come on, i know you're smarter than that.\u00a0 she hugged me, and for a moment, i wished she had begged me not to go. i considered the idea of staying, of resisting the money, and even the chance to see the moon.\u00a0 promise me you'll be here when i get back. i wouldn't dream of leaving this place without you. i'll be here waiting for you. me, and this planet with nothing but a single moon.\u00a0 at times i question myself.\u00a0what's so great about a planet that's essentially all water and almost no detectable land?\u00a0and i'll hear her saying how we could build floating houses or architectural structures like the maldives, or that we can bring out a boat from earth just like noah's ark and spend our days searching the blue world for a paradisiac island.\u00a0who knows, maybe we could even live in underwater domes like the atlanteans? i'll nod and chuckle to myself and say\u00a0sure\u00a0as if it's all so simple. i'll picture us both on\u00a0undine\u00a0drifting together in its never-ending pool. she and i, in our own private world, where we'll swim in our t-shirts and play with\u00a0michaelangelo.\u00a0 before i left, she gave me an envelope,\u00a0open it only once you're far away from\u00a0earth.\u00a0it's because of what she wrote that i know i'll return, that i'll tell her everything, from what i saw to what i dreamt. i'll say how much i remembered, how much i missed her, and i'll repeat the exact verse she wrote at the end of her letter; three words more significant to me than\u00a0undine\u00a0and its three moons.",

    "old_belief": "this poem is written by robert frost, a great american poet. the poem is about a young boy who loses his hand in an accident. the poem highlights what people feel about the young boy\u2019s passing and also death. the poet used references from shakespeare\u2019s macbeth to compare the unpreparedness and shock of death. death, child labor, and the fragility of life are the major themes of this poem. robert frost has highlighted the issue of child labor in this short poem. although the boy performs man\u2019s tasks, he is still an innocent child at heart. the ending of the poem is callous, shocking, and cruel. people behave indifferently to the death of that boy. there are no signs of mourning or sadness on their faces. they return to their work as if nothing has happened. the message is the absurdity that is there in life. the beauty of life is also surrounded by similar cruelty. all of its end in the meaninglessness of death. this shows that life can be fast and quick like a candle, gone within a blink of an eye. when things go wrong such as death there is a time when your sad and devote your time to what has just happened but also you have to go on with your own lives and not let it interfere with what you have going on.  the buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard  and made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,  sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.  and from there those that lifted eyes could count  five mountain ranges one behind the other  under the sunset far into vermont.  and the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,  as it ran light or had to bear a load.  and nothing happened: the day was all but done.  call it a day, i wish they might have said  to please the boy by giving him the half-hour  that a boy counts so much when saved from work.  his sister stood beside him in her apron  to tell them \u2018supper.\u2019 at the word, the saw,  as if to prove saws knew what supper meant,  leaped out at the boy\u2019s hand, or seemed to leap \u2014  he must have given the hand. however, it was,  neither refused the meeting. but the hand!  the boy\u2019s first outcry was a rueful laugh,  as he swung toward them holding up the hand  half in appeal, but half as if to keep  the life from spilling. then the boy saw all \u2014  since he was old enough to know, big boy  doing a man\u2019s work, though a child at heart \u2014  he saw all spoiled. \u2018don\u2019t let him cut my hand off \u2014  the doctor, when he comes. don\u2019t let him, sister!\u2019  so. but the hand was gone already.  the doctor put him in the dark of ether.  he lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.  and then \u2014 the watcher at his pulse took fright.  no one believed. they listened at his heart.  little \u2014 less \u2014 nothing! \u2014 and that ended it.  no more to build on there. and they, since they  were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.",

    "old_belief": "do dreams actually mean anything? it depends who you ask theories they do theories they don't common dream meanings interpreting your dreams takeaway psychologists, such as sigmund freud and carl jung, have long theorized on the deeper meaning of dreams. but other experts believe dreams don\u2019t have much meaning.  nina zivkovic/stocksy united some dreams slip away like minnows when you wake up and hazily try to grasp at them. others remain vivid in your memory, so clear and unforgettable that, as the days pass, you might start to wonder if you actually dreamed them more than once.  even if you don\u2019t remember many (or any) of your dreams, you do still have them. while experts still have plenty to discover about dreams, they do generally agreetrusted source that dreaming is part of the human experience.  you can cover a lot of ground in your dreams. common experiences include:  sexy encounters with a crush ordinary activities, like doing chores or buying groceries terrifying experiences, like returning to high school or being chased by monsters gaining superpowers or magical abilities whether your dreams are mundane or peculiar, you might want to know if they have any deeper significance. experts haven\u2019t come up with a clear answer, but you\u2019ll find some main theories below \u2014 along with a few tips for decoding your own dreams.   some experts think they do plenty of psychologists and other experts have theorized on the deeper meaning of dreams.  freud\u2019s theory of unconscious wish fulfillment psychologist sigmund freud had a lot to say about dreams (and not all of it related to sex).  he suggested that dreams helped protect peopletrusted source from waking up early when light or sound disrupted their sleep, but he also believed dreams pointed to buried desires.  your sleeping brain creates what he called a \u201cmanifest dream\u201d from snippets of everyday images, experiences, and memories. the manifest dream simplifies, reorganizes, and masks the \u201clatent dream,\u201d or your repressed and unconscious wishes.  in other words, the manifest dream uses various symbols and bizarre or unusual images to conceal the latent dream, or what you\u2019re really dreaming about.  jung\u2019s theory of compensation and self-portrayal like freud, carl jung believed dreams had meaning. jung focused on specific archetypes, or patterns, that appear symbolically in dreams, theorizing that dreams could help explain daily events and balance out aspects of yourself you aren\u2019t aware of yet.  say, for example, you have a lighthearted relationship with your partner. you enjoy the same hobbies, have great sexual chemistry, and get along well \u2014 but you can\u2019t shake the feeling that something deeper\u2019s missing from your relationship.  one night, you dream the two of you are reviewing housing listings, wandering through the furniture section of a department store, and then, suddenly (in the abrupt nature of dreams), taking a leisurely walk through a quiet park.  upon waking, you might realize your dream exposed some of the more mundane things absent in your relationship, while also suggesting you might want a relationship that includes thoughtful planning for the future along with fun.  other key theories other dream researchers have offered their own theories as to the meaning of dreams.  psychologist calvin s. hall considered dreams part of the cognition process, or a type of thinking that happens as you sleep.  since the images that appear in dreams reflect elements of daily life, hall believed dreams could offer important insight into how you view yourself and others, your problems and conflicts, and the world in general.  linguist and philosopher george lakoff believed dreams offered a metaphorical glimpse into daily challenges and life events. in other words, the abstract symbols appearing in your dreams represent real hardships.  psychologist and dream researcher rosalind cartwright also tied dreams to significant life events and emotional experiences. she believed dreams played an important role in cognitive processes, including memory and emotion regulation.  professor g. william domhoff also connected dreams to daily experiences. the things you do and think about during the day can resurface in dreams, he suggested, while your emotional mindset helps shape their unique content.  domhoff also noted that, although dreams may shed some light on heavy concerns, they might not have any real purpose. you forget most of your dreams, after all.  william dement, who helped found the field of sleep medicine, similarly suggested that, while dreams may lack a clear purpose, they can still convey meaningful messages.",

    "old_belief": "you\u2019re walking down a hazy road lined with antique streetlamps. the lights are glowing, faintly red, and splash pockets of color here and there along your path. the color begins to crawl out from under its given lamppost and all of the scenery becomes imbued, brushed in a singular hue of translucent rouge. suddenly, you\u2019re startled by a gruff voice from behind\u2014oh, a german shepherd, sitting at your feet. he speaks to you in a rhythmic bark ... a rhythmic bark. you awaken to the sound of the alarm clock and the sight of the warm morning sunlight.  it\u2019s not unusual to realize upon awakening that elements of our true physical surroundings have been incorporated into our dreams. though we normally consider sleep to be a time when we are completely cut off from the real world, in fact, there continues to be a flow of input from our sensory systems, which may be fluidly incorporated into a dream. of course, a strong enough stimulus would lead to an awakening, a fact that most of us take for granted when relying on an alarm clock.  research on external incorporation into dreams has explored the influences of several different sensory systems, including touch, sight, and smell, on our nightly creations. tactile experiments show that both pressure and temperature can influence the content of a dream. in a study conducted by nielsen (1993), participants wore a pressure cuff on their leg while sleeping in the laboratory. during rem sleep, experimenters inflated the cuff to produce pressure on the leg and subsequently awoke participants for dream reports. the authors found several examples of leg pressure incorporated into dreams, sometimes in a subtle yet direct fashion (ie, tingling in the leg), and sometimes in a more elaborate fashion (ie, a dream sequence that involved paralysis of the leg, attempts to move the leg resulting in intense discomfort). thus the physical sensation of pressure on the leg was incorporated in idiosyncratic ways, perhaps depending on the prior narrative of the dream or the quality of sleep.  in another niche of the dream field, researchers have made use of sensory stimuli as a tool for increasing lucidity. many of the sleep masks marketed for lucid dreaming rely on blinking red lights that flash during rem sleep; these red lights appear within the dream, and clue the dreamer into the fact that they are actually sleeping. successful users report seeing flashes of light in their dreams, for example \u201ci was walking along a road with my boss and the whole scene flashed, cueing me that i was dreaming. i mentioned it to him, and flew a little to prove it\u201d (subject dream report in laberge & levitan, 1995). in this case, the users rely on a premeditated cue to trigger lucidity. conceivably, other sensory signals, such as the pressure cuff, could similarly be used to induce lucid dreams.  one important question is just how much sensory stimuli is able to pierce through the barrier of sleep and into your dreams. probably there are variations in sensitivity, similar to waking experience, where certain individuals are more aware of sensory quality and bodily sensation than others. an original project by elizaveta solomonova will explore sensory incorporations in the dreams of vipassana meditators, a technique that focuses on awareness of body sensations. funded by mind and life institute, this project may reveal whether body-oriented contemplative practice alters embodied experience in dreams. in all cases, the impact of sensory stimuli on dreams suggests that the creation of dreams occurs as much in the body as it does in the mind, and underlines the role of the body in conscious experience.",

    "old_belief": "but others believe they don\u2019t many experts don\u2019t believe dreams have much meaning, but believe they still serve a purpose.  existing theories outline a few of these purposes.  threat simulation theory some researchers suggest that dreams serve an important evolutionary purpose.  according to threat simulation theory, dreams offer the chance to practice identifying, avoiding, and dealing with potential threats. by safely handling these threats in your dreams, you might feel safer in your waking life.  research from 2009trusted source found some support for this theory by comparing dreams of children who had experienced trauma with children who hadn\u2019t.  of course, threat simulation theory can also tie into other theories about dream meaning. traumatized children could, for example, have more threatening dreams, because they often feel afraid in daily life.  activation-synthesis theory according to the activation-synthesis theory, dreams are nothing more than a collection of random images and thoughts, projected during sleep as a result of normal brain activity.  these images don\u2019t follow any narrative structure, thanks to the pons, your brain\u2019s random dream generator. you create the story of your dream on your own, after waking up.  supporters of this theory believe dreams can feel strange, because these random images often make little sense when they\u2019re combined.  dreams as emotional regulation the unpleasant or unwanted emotions you experience in daily life can pop up in your dreams, too.  anxiety, guilt, sadness, or fear can quickly get overwhelming. but some experts have theorized that navigating these feelings in dreamland can help you begin resolving these feelings without all the stress.  wondering how that might work? well, when you dream during the rapid eye movement (rem) stage of sleep, the parts of the brain that help regulate emotion and memory are active.  what\u2019s not active is the chemical messenger noradrenalinetrusted source, which can produce feelings of anxiety or stress.  continual-activation theory your brain doesn\u2019t completely shut down when you go to sleep. instead, it uses this time to carry out important processes, including transferring short-term memories into long-term storage.  as you sleep, your brain also takes out the trash, in a manner of speaking, by getting rid of all the leftover, unnecessary information.  as your unconscious brain focuses on processing memories, activity in your conscious brain slows way down.  according to the continual-activation theory, this prompts your brain to send a flow of data from memory storage into the conscious brain. you can think of this data \u2014 aka your dreams \u2014 as a sort of screensaver keeping the conscious part of your brain up and running, despite the lack of actual activity.",

    "old_belief": "from shores of ancient bosphorus i write they appear in my inbox regularly, a couple times a year. i've grown accustomed to these clumsy, google-translated attempts at fraud and long stopped bothering to read them. but this time, when another message arrived via facebook, i noticed something unusual\u2014it was written, inexplicably, in turkish. the instantly translated text\u2014no longer via google\u2014clearly bore the hallmarks of neural network craftsmanship. admittedly, it handles language with far more diligence than i do. plus, turkey\u2014a pleasant geographical change of pace. better than yet another message from nigeria.  and then i remembered my favorite stanis\u0142aw lem novel\u2014the investigation. in one episode, ion tichy amuses himself by making digital copies of consciousnesses\u2014bertrand russell's, someone else's, and shakespeare's, i think\u2014chat with each other. my heart leaped with excitement. what had been pure science fiction in my parents' time had finally come to pass.  just the other day, i even got a call from a recruiter offering me a job as an analyst. the role involved listening to dialogues between two neural networks about some topic or another\u2014and trying to figure out why their conversation veered in whatever direction it did. to dispel my suspicions that he\u2014this recruiter\u2014might himself be a program, he brought up some recent news item, declaring that since he could discuss it, he couldn\u2019t possibly be a bot. i confirmed that i believed he was human, given that his argument was obviously complete nonsense. still, a lingering doubt remained\u2014and, i\u2019ll admit, a sliver of suspicion gnaws at me to this day.  so now, staring at this dm from a supposed turkish bank employee\u2014something distinctly alive and even willing to engage in dialogue\u2014i decided the time had finally come to act and, like ion tichy, to plug something in somewhere, dump data into some system, lean back in my chair, and enjoy the results in the style of john keats, mostly byron, and\u2014for the grand finale\u2014shakespeare. just like in lem's novel.  mahadi hasan:  from shores of ancient bosphorus i write, mahadi hasan fysun my name, a banker, destiny's guide. a tale i spin, of fortune's fading light, and kindred souls, across the world's wide tide.  adrian polski, of your land, now gone, in istanbul, his golden trade he plied. nine million dollars, sleeping, till the dawn, deposited here, before his spirit sighed.  no kin he claimed, no loving hand to hold, alone he passed, by cruel pandemic's sting. my bank knows not, their records yet unfold, a slumbering treasure, ripe for harvesting.  our names, dear george, a whispered symphony, a chance encounter, woven by the fates. i offer partnership, transparently, to claim this prize, before it dissipates.  half shall be yours, a noble, rightful share, legal protection, from all harm and fear. let silence shroud us, as we take our share, respond with haste, my friend, the hour is near.  george polskiy:  that fate divine arranged our meeting, i have doubt, though strange and wondrous paths our lives may tread. a banker from the bosporus, devout, with tales of gold a long-dead soul has shed. nine million dollars, quite a hefty clout, unclaimed, forgotten, like a dream misled. you seek a partner, honest, just, and true, to share the spoils, a fifty-fifty view.  alas, dear madam, your proposal grand, while tempting fate with promises untold, falls flat upon this barren, weary land. my heart is cold, my pockets lined with mold. i've chased no fortune, joined no greedy band, nor traded virtue for a *** of gold. seek elsewhere, friend, for gullible kin. mahadi hasan, go to hell, i mean.  mahadi hasan:  fear not, dear friend, i mean no treachery, my documents attest, this deal is pure and true, a transparent pact, beneath an open sky, and trust, the bridge we must together accrue. though many share your name, my heart can spy, a noble spirit, one who sees this through. this fortune, like a blessing, will descend, upon our houses, guided by my hand.  no legal labyrinth shall hinder our success, my bank, with parchment scrolls, shall make all plain, ownership affirmed, before the funds progress, to your account, where not a doubt shall remain. years spent in banking, grant me this finesse, the rules and systems, i perceive their grain. so trust my counsel, let no worry impede, the bond we forge, where mutual trust we breed.  george polskiy:  you claim no fraud, dear madam, 'tis your plea, with documents galore, all legal and bright. transparency, you say, our guide and glee, an umbrella of trust, to banish the night. my name is common, true, but you chose me, guided by instinct, a beacon of light. your trust i'll not disrupt, a soul so grand, this windfall's blessing, for yours and my hand.  but legal bridges, you say, hold no fright, a banker seasoned, with wisdom profound. their rules and regulations he wields tight, no cause for worry on a solid ground. yet trust, you see, is a fragile light, and promises whispered, is a hollow sound. so keep your millions and documents well, i will not sleep with devil. go to hell.  conclusion:  hark, facebook stranger, lend thine eery ear, to this strange tale of greed and cunning art. a banker from the east, with whispers clear, spins webs of deceit, to tear a soul apart.  with honeyed words and promises so grand, she lures her prey, a stranger from afar, with claims of kinship, and a helping hand, to steal a fortune, hidden in a jar.  but he, though tempted by such dazzling prize, sees through her mask, her motives dark and low. he spurns her offer, with a knowing guise, and bids her seek a fool, where shadows grow.  for honesty and virtue hold more worth, than ill-gained riches, stolen from the earth. #ai #scam #lem #turkey #nigeria #investigation #consciousness #science #bot",
    "new_belief": "on august 28, 1963, some 100 years after president abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves, a young man named martin luther king climbed the marble steps of the lincoln memorial in washington, d.c. to describe his vision of america. more than 200,000 people-black and white-came to listen. they came by plane, by car, by bus, by train, and by foot. they came to washington to demand equal rights for black people. and the dream that they heard on the steps of the monument became the dream of a generation.  as far as black americans were concerned, the nation\u2019s response to brown was agonizingly slow, and neither state legislatures nor the congress seemed willing to help their cause along. finally, president john f. kennedy recognized that only a strong civil rights bill would put teeth into the drive to secure equal protection of the laws for african americans. on june 11, 1963, he proposed such a bill to congress, asking for legislation that would provide \u201cthe kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves.\u201d southern representatives in congress managed to block the bill in committee, and civil rights leaders sought some way to build political momentum behind the measure.  a. philip randolph, a labor leader and longtime civil rights activist, called for a massive march on washington to dramatize the issue. he welcomed the participation of white groups as well as black in order to demonstrate the multiracial backing for civil rights. the various elements of the civil rights movement, many of which had been wary of one another, agreed to participate. the national association for the advancement of colored people, the congress of racial equality, the southern christian leadership conference, the student non-violent coordinating committee and the urban league all managed to bury their differences and work together. the leaders even agreed to tone down the rhetoric of some of the more militant activists for the sake of unity, and they worked closely with the kennedy administration, which hoped the march would, in fact, lead to passage of the civil rights bill.  on august 28, 1963, under a nearly cloudless sky, more than 250,000 people, a fifth of them white, gathered near the lincoln memorial in washington to rally for \u201cjobs and freedom.\u201d the roster of speakers included speakers from nearly every segment of society \u2014 labor leaders like walter reuther, clergy, film stars such as sidney poitier and marlon brando and folksingers such as joan baez. each of the speakers was allotted fifteen minutes, but the day belonged to the young and charismatic leader of the southern christian leadership conference.  dr. martin luther king jr. had originally prepared a short and somewhat formal recitation of the sufferings of african americans attempting to realize their freedom in a society chained by discrimination. he was about to sit down when gospel singer mahalia jackson called out, \u201ctell them about your dream, martin! tell them about the dream!\u201d encouraged by shouts from the audience, king drew upon some of his past talks, and the result became the landmark statement of civil rights in america \u2014 a dream of all people, of all races and colors and backgrounds, sharing in an america marked by freedom and democracy.  for further reading: herbert garfinkel, when negroes march: the march on washington\u2026(1969); taylor branch, parting the waters: america in the king years, 1954-1963 (1988); stephen b. oates, let the trumpet sound: the life of martin luther king jr. (1982). \u201ci have a dream\u201d (1963)  i am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  five score years ago, a great american, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the emancipation proclamation. this momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of whithering injustice. it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. but one hundred years later, the colored america is still not free. one hundred years later, the life of the colored american is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.  one hundred years later, the colored american lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. one hundred years later, the colored american is still languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land so we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.  in a sense we have come to our nation\u2019s capital to cash a check. when the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir.  this note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. instead of honoring this sacred obligation, america has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d  but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.  we have also come to his hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now. this is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.  now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.  now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.  now is the time to make justice a reality to all of god\u2019s children.  i would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it\u2019s colored citizens. this sweltering summer of the colored people\u2019s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. those who hope that the colored americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.  there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  we cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person\u2019s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \u201cfor white only.\u201d  we cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote.  no, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  i am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.  you have been the veterans of creative suffering. continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  go back to mississippi, go back to alabama, go back to south carolina go back to georgia, go back to louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.  let us not wallow in the valley of despair. i say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.  i still have a dream. it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream.  i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.  i have a dream that one day out in the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.  i have a dream today.  i have a dream that one day down in alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  i have a dream today.  i have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.  this is our hope. this is the faith that i will go back to the south with. with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.  with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  with this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  this will be the day when all of god\u2019s children will be able to sing with new meaning \u201cmy country \u2019tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee i sing. land where my father\u2019s died, land of the pilgrim\u2019s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!\u201d  and if america is to be a great nation, this must become true. so let freedom ring from the hilltops of new hampshire. let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york.  let freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania.  let freedom ring from the snow-capped rockies of colorado.  let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california.  but not only that, let freedom, ring from stone mountain of georgia.  let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippi and every mountainside.  when we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of god\u2019s children, black men and white men, jews and gentiles, protestants and catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old spiritual, \u201cfree at last, free at last. thank god almighty, we are free at last.\u201d",

    "old_belief": "on august 28, 1963, some 100 years after president abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves, a young man named martin luther king climbed the marble steps of the lincoln memorial in washington, d.c. to describe his vision of america. more than 200,000 people-black and white-came to listen. they came by plane, by car, by bus, by train, and by foot. they came to washington to demand equal rights for black people. and the dream that they heard on the steps of the monument became the dream of a generation.  as far as black americans were concerned, the nation\u2019s response to brown was agonizingly slow, and neither state legislatures nor the congress seemed willing to help their cause along. finally, president john f. kennedy recognized that only a strong civil rights bill would put teeth into the drive to secure equal protection of the laws for african americans. on june 11, 1963, he proposed such a bill to congress, asking for legislation that would provide \u201cthe kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves.\u201d southern representatives in congress managed to block the bill in committee, and civil rights leaders sought some way to build political momentum behind the measure.  a. philip randolph, a labor leader and longtime civil rights activist, called for a massive march on washington to dramatize the issue. he welcomed the participation of white groups as well as black in order to demonstrate the multiracial backing for civil rights. the various elements of the civil rights movement, many of which had been wary of one another, agreed to participate. the national association for the advancement of colored people, the congress of racial equality, the southern christian leadership conference, the student non-violent coordinating committee and the urban league all managed to bury their differences and work together. the leaders even agreed to tone down the rhetoric of some of the more militant activists for the sake of unity, and they worked closely with the kennedy administration, which hoped the march would, in fact, lead to passage of the civil rights bill.  on august 28, 1963, under a nearly cloudless sky, more than 250,000 people, a fifth of them white, gathered near the lincoln memorial in washington to rally for \u201cjobs and freedom.\u201d the roster of speakers included speakers from nearly every segment of society \u2014 labor leaders like walter reuther, clergy, film stars such as sidney poitier and marlon brando and folksingers such as joan baez. each of the speakers was allotted fifteen minutes, but the day belonged to the young and charismatic leader of the southern christian leadership conference.  dr. martin luther king jr. had originally prepared a short and somewhat formal recitation of the sufferings of african americans attempting to realize their freedom in a society chained by discrimination. he was about to sit down when gospel singer mahalia jackson called out, \u201ctell them about your dream, martin! tell them about the dream!\u201d encouraged by shouts from the audience, king drew upon some of his past talks, and the result became the landmark statement of civil rights in america \u2014 a dream of all people, of all races and colors and backgrounds, sharing in an america marked by freedom and democracy.  for further reading: herbert garfinkel, when negroes march: the march on washington\u2026(1969); taylor branch, parting the waters: america in the king years, 1954-1963 (1988); stephen b. oates, let the trumpet sound: the life of martin luther king jr. (1982). \u201ci have a dream\u201d (1963)  i am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  five score years ago, a great american, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the emancipation proclamation. this momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of whithering injustice. it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. but one hundred years later, the colored america is still not free. one hundred years later, the life of the colored american is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.  one hundred years later, the colored american lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. one hundred years later, the colored american is still languishing in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land so we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.  in a sense we have come to our nation\u2019s capital to cash a check. when the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir.  this note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. instead of honoring this sacred obligation, america has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d  but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. so we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.  we have also come to his hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now. this is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.  now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.  now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.  now is the time to make justice a reality to all of god\u2019s children.  i would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it\u2019s colored citizens. this sweltering summer of the colored people\u2019s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. those who hope that the colored americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.  there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  we cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person\u2019s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \u201cfor white only.\u201d  we cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote.  no, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  i am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.  you have been the veterans of creative suffering. continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  go back to mississippi, go back to alabama, go back to south carolina go back to georgia, go back to louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.  let us not wallow in the valley of despair. i say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.  i still have a dream. it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream.  i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.  i have a dream that one day out in the red hills of georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.  i have a dream today.  i have a dream that one day down in alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  i have a dream today.  i have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.  this is our hope. this is the faith that i will go back to the south with. with this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.  with this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  with this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  this will be the day when all of god\u2019s children will be able to sing with new meaning \u201cmy country \u2019tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee i sing. land where my father\u2019s died, land of the pilgrim\u2019s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!\u201d  and if america is to be a great nation, this must become true. so let freedom ring from the hilltops of new hampshire. let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york.  let freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania.  let freedom ring from the snow-capped rockies of colorado.  let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california.  but not only that, let freedom, ring from stone mountain of georgia.  let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippi and every mountainside.  when we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of god\u2019s children, black men and white men, jews and gentiles, protestants and catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old spiritual, \u201cfree at last, free at last. thank god almighty, we are free at last.\u201d",

you made this?\u2019 he looked around at the boardwalk we were standing on. people walked passed us, unconcerned with our conversation.  \u201ci took a second to think about his question this time. i couldn\u2019t tell you what i was thinking about before he came up to me and, now that he brought it up, there was a certain oddness to the day. i looked down at the railing i was leaning on and felt it. the wood was old and rough, splintering beneath my fingers as i ran them slowly over it. this was too real to be a dream.  \u201ci looked back at the man. \u2018why do you ask?\u2019  \u201c\u2018you were the only one looking at the waves.\u2019 i turned back to the beach. nobody was on it. the man took a step toward me. \u2018sir? who am i?\u2019  \u201ci woke in my flat, transported from that distant place. i had to look and make sure it was the 4th. i was a little surprised that it was.  \u201canalysis: my dreams do indeed continue to get more vivid, to the point where they are almost indistinguishable from reality. i was approached last night. this man spoke to me but not with the typical reactive nature that most conversations in dreams consist of. he asked me questions. he asked me an existential question. i don\u2019t know the meaning of this or its significance.\u201d  i closed out of the dream journal and thought on the subject for a while. perhaps my subconscious was just creating more vivid and realistic worlds. i decided to stop dwelling on nonsense and start the day. i looked out the window at the january snow falling to the streets below.  i walked out of the room past the magnetic shielding to continue my work. the capacitors in the nanobots residing in my brain allowed for twenty minutes of operation outside of the magnetic field. every twenty minutes i would take a break and go back into my bedroom\u2019s b-field and recharge. i was working on a solution for that problem.  that work got easier every day. the nanobots increased the connections between my neurons and the artificial electrodes. i was the only person with the means and will to attempt intelligence amplification, and little by little, i was becoming the most intelligent person the planet had ever seen. the computer power of my brain in just the early stages of my development already far surpassed anything anyone had seen.  i was working on a new generation of nanobots that would be powered by the electrolytes in my blood. this would take away my need to be tethered to my flat and the magnetic field inside. i could go back down onto the streets and walk around. i was originally going to use a piezoelectric membrane on the nanobots and pump ultrasound into my brain. but that was before i had my upgraded prefrontal cortex and was able to make electrolyte-powered nanos possible.  \u201ci found him again. i was able to find the same boardwalk. the dreams are getting longer as my computing power increases; it felt like i waited for days on that beach. i\u2019m looking at the data now and yes, it was equivalent to six days. after all that time on the beach he finally approached me from behind, just as he did the first time.  \u201c\u2019are you dreaming?\u2019  \u201cit had been days. i had given up on seeing him again, so the second time caught me off guard as well. i turned around to the voice. \u2018excuse me?\u201d as soon as i saw him i recognized him. he had soft, hazel eyes and brown hair, something i only knew before but could see now. he stood up tall like he was forcing himself to do so, like he was mustering up the courage to talk to a childhood hero and putting on a brave face.  \u201c\u2018you are dreaming aren\u2019t you? you made this?\u201d  \u201c\u2018yes, i think i did. you want to know who you are. so do i. tell me about yourself.\u2019  \u201c\u2018yes sir. i live in that house over there.\u2019 he pointed to a house just beyond the boardwalk. \u2018i like to watch the waves. you\u2019re the only other person that does.\u2019  \u201c\u2018i was waiting for you.\u2019  \u201c\u2018me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018is this the first time you\u2019ve spoken to me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018yes sir. it took me a few days to work up the courage.\u2019 shame seemed to subtly slide across his face as he admitted that.  \u201c\u2018do you have a name?\u2019  \u201c\u2018a name, sir?\u2019  \u201cand then i woke. the bastard wasted too much time working up his courage. again i had to look at the window and make sure it was april 11th. indeed only one night had passed.  \u201canalysis: definite hints of emotions and sentience.\u201d  i got out of bed and readied for the day. it was my biweekly adventure down the tower and into civilization.  the puddles splashed beneath my feet as i walked the two blocks to the store. people snapped pictures of me as i passed them on the sidewalk, but i paid them no mind. being amongst them was as good as interaction for me. i would try to keep my sustenance gathering to as close to twenty minutes as possible. i couldn\u2019t afford to lose any time on my progress. rather, i didn\u2019t want to. i made it quick and grabbed the essentials. whatever i missed could be acquired by an assistant and brought to the top of the tower.  \u201cas i progress, the dreams are more frequently playing like simulations that i observe rather than participate in. they are still impossibly long. i watched a family live their lives for years last night. the dreams appear to be growing by a few percentage points per day as the nanobots increase the neurological connections.  \u201cthis brings in to question the ethics of my undertaking in to amplified intelligence. these beings in my dreams are clearly sentient, albeit simple, creatures. they question their existence and meaning. when i wake, their simulation ceases, and with it so does their existence. i give them life and then take it away.  \u201cbut all in all, they are an annoying byproduct of my goals. they would have no existence at all without me. i shall have no more empathy for them.  \u201cas electrolyte-powered nanobots near printing, i am ready to integrate the bascs supercomputer system into my nervous system. coupling my brain with bascs will give me an astronomical amount of computing power. i don\u2019t know what life will be like after.\u201d  time is irrelevant there is only information.  \u201ci have awoken for the first time since being coupled with the bascs. much like before, my dreams ran like simulations, but this time on massive proportions. the shear amount of data collected has been enormous. i have run a simulation of an entire universe, although much simpler than the one we live in.  \u201cthe simulation began with an instant introduction of space and energy. quite literally astronomical amounts of space and energy. energy condensed into particles, particles condensed into atoms, atoms condensed into galaxies filled with star systems.  \u201ci believe my subconscious guided the simulation. the reason i believe this is because life only formed in one of these countless star systems, and, as it evolved, many of the species that arose exist here in the real world. including us. they were by far the most fascinating things to come out of this simulation, this dream.  \u201cwhole civilizations arose. they were self-questioning, inquisitive, inventive. they called themselves man, human, or homo sapiens and their planet on which they lived earth. i could interact with them, but i enjoyed observing from afar.  \u201cthey discovered much about their universe. even to the point where their instruments could see to smaller levels than my simulation\u2019s physics could allow for. their work was admirable but now i am awake, and they are nothing.\u201d  i stood up and walked out of the b-field into the lab. i deleted the plans for the electrolyte nanobots waiting to be printed. and watched the first snow of the winter fall onto the streets below.",

she once asked sarcastically.\u00a0how about a drone that we can use transport food from the fridge up to the treehouse, huh? wouldn't that be neat?\u00a0 when we were kids, i would give her piggyback rides and we\u2019d run through the sprinklers across watery arches with captured rainbows. we'd go back home, and my mother would scold us while our shivering bodies shared a single towel, and in the end, she'd shine me a blue-lipped smile with her crooked teeth. that was fun, wasn't it?\u00a0\u00a0 our childhood adventures involved trips to the public pool, wet t-shirts, and popsicles mucking up our fingers under the august sun. she'd take me to her soccer team's practices, and i'd watch her run up and down while i built rovers and complex constructs out of legos on the bleachers. booyah!\u00a0she'd shout after scoring a goal. i'd cheer or clap, and she would always gleam and say the same thing.\u00a0goooooooaaaaallllll. and that's how the west was won. a few years later, our tastes matured, slipping our summers into memories and substituting them for funky clothing and car rides on the empty freeway. she and i would stop on the roadsides by green fields that looked blue under the night sky. we'd sit under the blanket of stars and watch the moon while dreaming up our futures after high school.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm going to apply for a sports scholarship and get the fuck out of this town,\u00a0she'd always say.\u00a0how about you? i don't know.\u00a0i shrugged.\u00a0maybe i'll go work with my dad as an apprentice at his accounting firm. what? come on, you got to apply for university too. you're a freakin brainiac. i'm sure you could get into any school. out the bay window, i see the lunar triplets:\u00a0euphrosyne, aglia,\u00a0and\u00a0nathalia\u00a0dancing around what the new worlds association likes to call\u00a0undine, the flooded, blue planet, equivalent in size to jupiter, that i've been studying for what would be measured, on planet earth, as eight months.\u00a0 the journey to this specific star system took four years. the rest of the crew and i have enough resources to last another sixteen\u00a0earth\u00a0months. by then, we'll have made a substantial dent in our research. our food, water, fuel, along with our tolerance for the presence of one another, will have depleted, and we'll go into cryosleep for our return. a decade, that's how long we'll have been apart.\u00a0 so you'll be asleep, frozen in a coffin for about eight years?\u00a0 i assured her that it was completely safe, that i wouldn't die in transport.\u00a0 but doesn't that mean that you'll come back looking almost the same as when you left? won't you technically be younger than me? i think about her current age. how it's already been more than 8 years, and how unfair it must have seemed to her; that she'd miss me in the entirety of all that elapsed time while i'd be sleeping almost all the years away, except for two.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes i wonder if she tells her other friends and customers about me.\u00a0my buddy's up in space,\u00a0i imagine her saying.\u00a0what's he doing up there?

and what do you think i should do? if i were as wicked smart as you, i'd go to the moon! scientists are some of the professionals that, depending on their branch of specialization, are often courted by big-money tech companies and international organizations. she heard about a space program from one of her faithful customers, a man that worked as a research assistant for the state university who always ordered a bear claw with a large cup of coffee and a blt for the road. she told me how the new worlds association was looking for people to\u00a0blast off, in her own words, into space. that the money i'd receive would leave me set for life.\u00a0\u00a0 she was the one that showed me the association's website.\u00a0it says here you have to send them a paper or something explaining your qualifications, along with an idea for a project applicable in space, highlighting a specific area of research. does that sound like something you could do? huh?\u00a0i was distracted at first by the site's banner, a rocket blasting off into the moon, pointing like an arrowhead to the unknown.\u00a0i think so,\u00a0i answered, correcting myself.\u00a0but \u2014 but what if i get accepted? that's what i should have asked.\u00a0but what if they don't think i'm qualified enough? what if i'm rejected? then they're crazy,\u00a0she snapped back.\u00a0you're the most intelligent person i know! no way, they'd reject you.\u00a0 i pitched her my project several times, letting her serve as my judge and jury. the idea was simple, build a compact, remote-operated device that could probe the oceanic planet of\u00a0undine.\u00a0 do you mean like a robotic hand? exactly, think of it like a hand that's also like a drone,\u00a0i said.\u00a0a machine that could enter the planet and try to collect data on whether there are any living organisms present in the planet's aquatic terrain or not. if the scan is positive, it'll extract several samples for me and the crew. some of these samples can undergo analysis and testing while in space, and others could be stored in a controlled environment on the spacecraft and transported back home with us.\u00a0 she stared at me for a few seconds, her eyes wide and her mouth nearly dangling from her jaw like a bell.\u00a0 so...what do you think? i think you're going into space.\u00a0 the admiration in her eyes was stunning and had me gleaming like a young boy.\u00a0who knows, maybe we'll even stop by the moon on our return? the probe,\u00a0michaelangelo, named by myself, will enter\u00a0undine's\u00a0domain in approximately two weeks. from our current distance, the device's descent will take anywhere from two to three days. that's when my mission will reach its zenith and when things could get dicey. i'll have to watch over\u00a0michaelangelo\u00a0as if it's a newborn child learning to swim. i'll also have to frequently analyze\u00a0undine's\u00a0tidal patterns and climate while observing the incoming data as soon as\u00a0michaelangelo\u00a0departs from the spacecraft. do you think michaelangelo will make it out of that place in one piece?\u00a0she asked with a worried expression as if the probe was a living creature, a pet cat or dog. i think so. i'm working with a pretty big budget, and it'll be made exclusively for the mission. knowing you'll be the one to build him, i'm sure he'll be great! no, i'm wrong. michaelangelo\u00a0will be better than great. he'll be fucking perfect.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm glad one of us is feeling confident,\u00a0i returned, leaning back into her sofa. she plopped himself right beside me, threw her arm over my neck, and pulled me into her orbit with such savagery that we ended up rolling onto the floor. she flipped herself over, partially resting her chest over mine,\u00a0don't be so hard on yourself. i believe in you. i'll miss you, you know that, right?\u00a0i gushed. we hadn't talked about the possibility of my leaving, camouflaging the void that would be left behind with excitement and speculation. my eyes at that moment reddened, burned much like they always do whenever i think of her. hey, it'll be a good opportunity for you, won't it? you'll be doing something you're good at, something that could help everyone back here on planet earth.\u00a0\u00a0 onboard the spaceship, there's a mechanic who's responsible for repairs and keeping the ship functioning, who sometimes also gets the chance to soar like an acrobat in the depths of space. we have a medic doing research on the proliferation of diseases under low gravity conditions.\u00a0 they all sound like show-offs, that's what!\u00a0 there's also a physicist and a botanist. our pilot's one of the few men to have traveled multiple times to the moon and mars, as well as a skilled photographer who captured high-definition photos of cosmic dust clouds, and then there's me, a certified scientist, as she'd like to say.\u00a0 a certified scientist who won himself a round trip ticket to space.\u00a0 weeks before my leave, we were lying close to one another in a field of dark-blue grass.\u00a0you're going to do big things up there,\u00a0she said. she turned and shined me her crooked smile.\u00a0and when you're back, everyone is going to know your name.\u00a0 you know i don't care about any of that stuff. i'm much more interested in seeing the planet with the three moons. i swear, love, only you.\u00a0\u00a0 everyone here talks about their projects, comments on how much they miss their family. our captain left his wife three months pregnant back home, our mechanic and our medic, two kids each. when they turn to me and ask if i've left anything important behind, the first person that comes to mind isn't my mother or father, a house or a car; it's her.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm the quiet one up here. space is already deathly silent, but it and i enter into staring contests with each other through the bay window, my eyes versus\u00a0undine's\u00a0three moons. i watch them, the triplets that grace the aquatic planet, drawing up conclusions as to what might occur if one of the lunar bodies were to simply explode. obviously, there'd be no sound, but i'd watch the floating remnants, mesmerized by the rubble as if catching the sight of fallen snow. in this particular star system, aside from all the planets and moons spread out across the field of space, there's also a bright celestial body similar to the sun back home. the lone star is distant from everything, the same way that i'm years away from my planet and from the only person more important to me than anything in the whole universe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how do you think things will be like once i'm back?\u00a0i asked her before i left for my physical and mental training.\u00a0 what do you mean?\u00a0she returned.\u00a0 will we still be \u2014 you're kidding, right? come on, i know you're smarter than that.\u00a0 she hugged me, and for a moment, i wished she had begged me not to go. i considered the idea of staying, of resisting the money, and even the chance to see the moon.\u00a0 promise me you'll be here when i get back. i wouldn't dream of leaving this place without you. i'll be here waiting for you. me, and this planet with nothing but a single moon.\u00a0 at times i question myself.\u00a0what's so great about a planet that's essentially all water and almost no detectable land?\u00a0and i'll hear her saying how we could build floating houses or architectural structures like the maldives, or that we can bring out a boat from earth just like noah's ark and spend our days searching the blue world for a paradisiac island.\u00a0who knows, maybe we could even live in underwater domes like the atlanteans? i'll nod and chuckle to myself and say\u00a0sure\u00a0as if it's all so simple. i'll picture us both on\u00a0undine\u00a0drifting together in its never-ending pool. she and i, in our own private world, where we'll swim in our t-shirts and play with\u00a0michaelangelo.\u00a0 before i left, she gave me an envelope,\u00a0open it only once you're far away from\u00a0earth.\u00a0it's because of what she wrote that i know i'll return, that i'll tell her everything, from what i saw to what i dreamt. i'll say how much i remembered, how much i missed her, and i'll repeat the exact verse she wrote at the end of her letter; three words more significant to me than\u00a0undine\u00a0and its three moons.",
    "source": "20 years in space   she comes to me in pieces as i watch the stillness of space, envisioning new constellations in the array of unrecognized stars. i trace the sparks of light with my finger, connecting the dots and smudging the glass as a result.\u00a0\u00a0 how many stars do you think there are in space?\u00a0i imagine her asking.\u00a0can there really be other ones out there as big as or even bigger than the sun?\u00a0 i always admired her genuine curiosity, how she viewed things with a particular interest, how she saw me. she was the one that organized our sleepovers, the one that nudged me to sign up for afterschool activities such as the chemistry club and the robotics team.\u00a0\u00a0 can you build me a mechanical arm that'll change the channels on the tv's remote, so that way i don't have to? she once asked sarcastically.\u00a0how about a drone that we can use transport food from the fridge up to the treehouse, huh? wouldn't that be neat?\u00a0 when we were kids, i would give her piggyback rides and we\u2019d run through the sprinklers across watery arches with captured rainbows. we'd go back home, and my mother would scold us while our shivering bodies shared a single towel, and in the end, she'd shine me a blue-lipped smile with her crooked teeth. that was fun, wasn't it?\u00a0\u00a0 our childhood adventures involved trips to the public pool, wet t-shirts, and popsicles mucking up our fingers under the august sun. she'd take me to her soccer team's practices, and i'd watch her run up and down while i built rovers and complex constructs out of legos on the bleachers. booyah!\u00a0she'd shout after scoring a goal. i'd cheer or clap, and she would always gleam and say the same thing.\u00a0goooooooaaaaallllll. and that's how the west was won. a few years later, our tastes matured, slipping our summers into memories and substituting them for funky clothing and car rides on the empty freeway. she and i would stop on the roadsides by green fields that looked blue under the night sky. we'd sit under the blanket of stars and watch the moon while dreaming up our futures after high school.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm going to apply for a sports scholarship and get the fuck out of this town,\u00a0she'd always say.\u00a0how about you? i don't know.\u00a0i shrugged.\u00a0maybe i'll go work with my dad as an apprentice at his accounting firm. what? come on, you got to apply for university too. you're a freakin brainiac. i'm sure you could get into any school. out the bay window, i see the lunar triplets:\u00a0euphrosyne, aglia,\u00a0and\u00a0nathalia\u00a0dancing around what the new worlds association likes to call\u00a0undine, the flooded, blue planet, equivalent in size to jupiter, that i've been studying for what would be measured, on planet earth, as eight months.\u00a0 the journey to this specific star system took four years. the rest of the crew and i have enough resources to last another sixteen\u00a0earth\u00a0months. by then, we'll have made a substantial dent in our research. our food, water, fuel, along with our tolerance for the presence of one another, will have depleted, and we'll go into cryosleep for our return. a decade, that's how long we'll have been apart.\u00a0 so you'll be asleep, frozen in a coffin for about eight years?\u00a0 i assured her that it was completely safe, that i wouldn't die in transport.\u00a0 but doesn't that mean that you'll come back looking almost the same as when you left? won't you technically be younger than me? i think about her current age. how it's already been more than 8 years, and how unfair it must have seemed to her; that she'd miss me in the entirety of all that elapsed time while i'd be sleeping almost all the years away, except for two.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes i wonder if she tells her other friends and customers about me.\u00a0my buddy's up in space,\u00a0i imagine her saying.\u00a0what's he doing up there?

she once asked sarcastically.\u00a0how about a drone that we can use transport food from the fridge up to the treehouse, huh? wouldn't that be neat?\u00a0 when we were kids, i would give her piggyback rides and we\u2019d run through the sprinklers across watery arches with captured rainbows. we'd go back home, and my mother would scold us while our shivering bodies shared a single towel, and in the end, she'd shine me a blue-lipped smile with her crooked teeth. that was fun, wasn't it?\u00a0\u00a0 our childhood adventures involved trips to the public pool, wet t-shirts, and popsicles mucking up our fingers under the august sun. she'd take me to her soccer team's practices, and i'd watch her run up and down while i built rovers and complex constructs out of legos on the bleachers. booyah!\u00a0she'd shout after scoring a goal. i'd cheer or clap, and she would always gleam and say the same thing.\u00a0goooooooaaaaallllll. and that's how the west was won. a few years later, our tastes matured, slipping our summers into memories and substituting them for funky clothing and car rides on the empty freeway. she and i would stop on the roadsides by green fields that looked blue under the night sky. we'd sit under the blanket of stars and watch the moon while dreaming up our futures after high school.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm going to apply for a sports scholarship and get the fuck out of this town,\u00a0she'd always say.\u00a0how about you? i don't know.\u00a0i shrugged.\u00a0maybe i'll go work with my dad as an apprentice at his accounting firm. what? come on, you got to apply for university too. you're a freakin brainiac. i'm sure you could get into any school. out the bay window, i see the lunar triplets:\u00a0euphrosyne, aglia,\u00a0and\u00a0nathalia\u00a0dancing around what the new worlds association likes to call\u00a0undine, the flooded, blue planet, equivalent in size to jupiter, that i've been studying for what would be measured, on planet earth, as eight months.\u00a0 the journey to this specific star system took four years. the rest of the crew and i have enough resources to last another sixteen\u00a0earth\u00a0months. by then, we'll have made a substantial dent in our research. our food, water, fuel, along with our tolerance for the presence of one another, will have depleted, and we'll go into cryosleep for our return. a decade, that's how long we'll have been apart.\u00a0 so you'll be asleep, frozen in a coffin for about eight years?\u00a0 i assured her that it was completely safe, that i wouldn't die in transport.\u00a0 but doesn't that mean that you'll come back looking almost the same as when you left? won't you technically be younger than me? i think about her current age. how it's already been more than 8 years, and how unfair it must have seemed to her; that she'd miss me in the entirety of all that elapsed time while i'd be sleeping almost all the years away, except for two.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes i wonder if she tells her other friends and customers about me.\u00a0my buddy's up in space,\u00a0i imagine her saying.\u00a0what's he doing up there? he's researching a new planet, someplace better than this shit hole we're destroying.\u00a0 undine\u00a0registers an oxygen signature similar to europa and planet earth. the oceanic surface covering the entire planet could host a form of phytoplankton or an entirely new plant species capable of producing oxygen as a byproduct of their natural photosynthetic process. in other words,\u00a0undine\u00a0could, in theory, host life.\u00a0 if i'm being honest with myself, sometimes i feel that my role on this ship isn't as relevant as the other crew members' works. that perhaps what i'm doing isn't as impacting, that it's less exciting. i'm not spacewalking or trying to merge chemical compounds under zero-gravity conditions. i barely passed the physical exam, and my score on the simulatory emergency program ranked me as the fifth in command if anything were to happen to our pilot or the others of my crew.\u00a0\u00a0 so what?\u00a0she'd fire out.\u00a0you'll still be one of the few guys part of the human race to have ever gone up to space. you'll still have broken records, be mentioned in the history books. you'll have gone places no one has ever been to.\u00a0 \u00a0 it was always like her to see the bright side in situations. when she didn't get her full-ride to college, she applied for the town's undergrad program at the local college.\u00a0don't worry, hun, i'm still going to make it back and get myself out of this place. when she couldn't juggle both her academic life and work to help her folks pay the bills, she still didn't crumble under all the pressure.\u00a0i'll take a break this semester, and then on the next one, i'll go back.\u00a0 she never returned to school to finish her undergrad.\u00a0maybe college just isn't for me.\u00a0she opted to continue working, helping out her folks, and eventually went to, and finished, trade school.\u00a0i'm thinking about opening a restaurant.\u00a0she told me years ago.\u00a0what about you, what are you thinking about doing with your life, huh, mr. big shot imma certified scientist? i laughed at her remark.\u00a0i don't know,\u00a0i answered.\u00a0i guess i could teach or go for my ph.d. what? but you just finished school, now you're thinking about going back?\u00a0she commented while scratching her head. she tugged on the bill of her baseball cap and shook her head in disapproval.\u00a0you're nuts, homeboy!\u00a0 yeah? and what do you think i should do? if i were as wicked smart as you, i'd go to the moon! scientists are some of the professionals that, depending on their branch of specialization, are often courted by big-money tech companies and international organizations. she heard about a space program from one of her faithful customers, a man that worked as a research assistant for the state university who always ordered a bear claw with a large cup of coffee and a blt for the road. she told me how the new worlds association was looking for people to\u00a0blast off, in her own words, into space. that the money i'd receive would leave me set for life.\u00a0\u00a0 she was the one that showed me the association's website.\u00a0it says here you have to send them a paper or something explaining your qualifications, along with an idea for a project applicable in space, highlighting a specific area of research. does that sound like something you could do? huh?\u00a0i was distracted at first by the site's banner, a rocket blasting off into the moon, pointing like an arrowhead to the unknown.\u00a0i think so,\u00a0i answered, correcting myself.\u00a0but \u2014 but what if i get accepted? that's what i should have asked.\u00a0but what if they don't think i'm qualified enough? what if i'm rejected? then they're crazy,\u00a0she snapped back.\u00a0you're the most intelligent person i know! no way, they'd reject you.\u00a0 i pitched her my project several times, letting her serve as my judge and jury. the idea was simple, build a compact, remote-operated device that could probe the oceanic planet of\u00a0undine.\u00a0 do you mean like a robotic hand? exactly, think of it like a hand that's also like a drone,\u00a0i said.\u00a0a machine that could enter the planet and try to collect data on whether there are any living organisms present in the planet's aquatic terrain or not. if the scan is positive, it'll extract several samples for me and the crew. some of these samples can undergo analysis and testing while in space, and others could be stored in a controlled environment on the spacecraft and transported back home with us.\u00a0 she stared at me for a few seconds, her eyes wide and her mouth nearly dangling from her jaw like a bell.\u00a0 so...what do you think? i think you're going into space.\u00a0 the admiration in her eyes was stunning and had me gleaming like a young boy.\u00a0who knows, maybe we'll even stop by the moon on our return? the probe,\u00a0michaelangelo, named by myself, will enter\u00a0undine's\u00a0domain in approximately two weeks. from our current distance, the device's descent will take anywhere from two to three days. that's when my mission will reach its zenith and when things could get dicey. i'll have to watch over\u00a0michaelangelo\u00a0as if it's a newborn child learning to swim. i'll also have to frequently analyze\u00a0undine's\u00a0tidal patterns and climate while observing the incoming data as soon as\u00a0michaelangelo\u00a0departs from the spacecraft. do you think michaelangelo will make it out of that place in one piece?\u00a0she asked with a worried expression as if the probe was a living creature, a pet cat or dog. i think so. i'm working with a pretty big budget, and it'll be made exclusively for the mission. knowing you'll be the one to build him, i'm sure he'll be great! no, i'm wrong. michaelangelo\u00a0will be better than great. he'll be fucking perfect.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm glad one of us is feeling confident,\u00a0i returned, leaning back into her sofa. she plopped himself right beside me, threw her arm over my neck, and pulled me into her orbit with such savagery that we ended up rolling onto the floor. she flipped herself over, partially resting her chest over mine,\u00a0don't be so hard on yourself. i believe in you. i'll miss you, you know that, right?\u00a0i gushed. we hadn't talked about the possibility of my leaving, camouflaging the void that would be left behind with excitement and speculation. my eyes at that moment reddened, burned much like they always do whenever i think of her. hey, it'll be a good opportunity for you, won't it? you'll be doing something you're good at, something that could help everyone back here on planet earth.\u00a0\u00a0 onboard the spaceship, there's a mechanic who's responsible for repairs and keeping the ship functioning, who sometimes also gets the chance to soar like an acrobat in the depths of space. we have a medic doing research on the proliferation of diseases under low gravity conditions.\u00a0 they all sound like show-offs, that's what!\u00a0 there's also a physicist and a botanist. our pilot's one of the few men to have traveled multiple times to the moon and mars, as well as a skilled photographer who captured high-definition photos of cosmic dust clouds, and then there's me, a certified scientist, as she'd like to say.\u00a0 a certified scientist who won himself a round trip ticket to space.\u00a0 weeks before my leave, we were lying close to one another in a field of dark-blue grass.\u00a0you're going to do big things up there,\u00a0she said. she turned and shined me her crooked smile.\u00a0and when you're back, everyone is going to know your name.\u00a0 you know i don't care about any of that stuff. i'm much more interested in seeing the planet with the three moons. i swear, love, only you.\u00a0\u00a0 everyone here talks about their projects, comments on how much they miss their family. our captain left his wife three months pregnant back home, our mechanic and our medic, two kids each. when they turn to me and ask if i've left anything important behind, the first person that comes to mind isn't my mother or father, a house or a car; it's her.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm the quiet one up here. space is already deathly silent, but it and i enter into staring contests with each other through the bay window, my eyes versus\u00a0undine's\u00a0three moons. i watch them, the triplets that grace the aquatic planet, drawing up conclusions as to what might occur if one of the lunar bodies were to simply explode. obviously, there'd be no sound, but i'd watch the floating remnants, mesmerized by the rubble as if catching the sight of fallen snow. in this particular star system, aside from all the planets and moons spread out across the field of space, there's also a bright celestial body similar to the sun back home. the lone star is distant from everything, the same way that i'm years away from my planet and from the only person more important to me than anything in the whole universe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how do you think things will be like once i'm back?\u00a0i asked her before i left for my physical and mental training.\u00a0 what do you mean?\u00a0she returned.\u00a0 will we still be \u2014 you're kidding, right? come on, i know you're smarter than that.\u00a0 she hugged me, and for a moment, i wished she had begged me not to go. i considered the idea of staying, of resisting the money, and even the chance to see the moon.\u00a0 promise me you'll be here when i get back. i wouldn't dream of leaving this place without you. i'll be here waiting for you. me, and this planet with nothing but a single moon.\u00a0 at times i question myself.\u00a0what's so great about a planet that's essentially all water and almost no detectable land?\u00a0and i'll hear her saying how we could build floating houses or architectural structures like the maldives, or that we can bring out a boat from earth just like noah's ark and spend our days searching the blue world for a paradisiac island.\u00a0who knows, maybe we could even live in underwater domes like the atlanteans? i'll nod and chuckle to myself and say\u00a0sure\u00a0as if it's all so simple. i'll picture us both on\u00a0undine\u00a0drifting together in its never-ending pool. she and i, in our own private world, where we'll swim in our t-shirts and play with\u00a0michaelangelo.\u00a0 before i left, she gave me an envelope,\u00a0open it only once you're far away from\u00a0earth.\u00a0it's because of what she wrote that i know i'll return, that i'll tell her everything, from what i saw to what i dreamt. i'll say how much i remembered, how much i missed her, and i'll repeat the exact verse she wrote at the end of her letter; three words more significant to me than\u00a0undine\u00a0and its three moons.",
