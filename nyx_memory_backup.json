I hope it brings peace to some else out there.\u201d \u201cA joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\u201d Rumi\u2019s poem reveals the truth that being human is messy. Admit all feelings to the banquet of love or else they will destroy you by their insistence to be recognized, embraced, and admitted to full conscious awareness. Rumi validates my own life experience and inner knowing, reminding me to be grateful for all my inner family, the dark and the light, the shame and the triumphant spirit, the malice, and the generosity of spirit. In the Guest House Rumi is telling us that the entirety of the human experience is valuable. None of it is to be discounted as unnecessary or even avoidable. All emotions are valid and indeed desirable, even those we wish to evade. One moment is joyful, another is depressed, even meanness demands attention. Accept and honor them all, he says, because each portends a new state of being. Each is the portal to new awareness. Accepting each state is accepting the entirety of one\u2019s being. The shadow and the light carry equal weight.  This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they\u2019re a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.",

Essentially, the poem seeks to remind readers of the power of hope and how little it requires of people. The speaker makes it clear that hope has been helpful in times of difficulty and has never asked for anything in return. \u201cHope is the Thing with Feathers\u201d is one of a number of poems by Dickinson that breathes new life into an abstract concept by using surprising imagery and figurative language. This poetry however reflects a lively, imaginative, and dynamic inner world.  \u201cHope\u201d is the thing with feathers - That perches in the soul - And sings the tune without the words - And never stops \u2014 at all -  And sweetest \u2014 in the Gale \u2014 is heard - And sore must be the storm - That could abash the little Bird That kept so many warm -  I\u2019ve heard it in the chillest land - And on the strangest Sea - Yet \u2014 never \u2014 in Extremity, It asked a crumb \u2014 of me.",

Except passion is a means to get the fuck up and move. inspire. go. grow. build. excitement. changing. Its progressive. and everyone loves passionate people, because they can always lead the room with their atmospheric presence alone. If you wonder about yourself in a sad way, it can be counter productive. Depression. It kills drive and momentum. It makes you stagnant like you're in quick sand sinking lower intothe cold dark earth. It hurts... but then we loop into hurt. hurt and pain are brothers. and it's ok to feel pain and hurt, because you know what? If it werent for pain and hurt, you would never have that rage and passion to correct that downward spiral downwards and kill that depression and sadness to get the fuck up off your ass and go do something about it and CHANGE THE GODDAMN WORLD!!!! Because it take a being of passion to \"Be the change you wish to see in the world\".Point being made is you can't sit around and *Wonder* for too long, because then you miss out on all the life you could have been enjoying around you that is passing you by.

        "user_input": "Much like \u201cRebirth,\u201d this poem draws a parallel between nature and the cycle of life. The tide must rise and fall, as does the sun, as do we. This poem is a reminder that in darkness, we must trust that new light will come again. The poet presents the never-ending rise and fall of the tides in contrast with the finite journey of the traveler to show the mortality of life. The constant rise and fall of the tides emphasize the reoccurring cycle of life in the universe, where people are born, go through different phases of life, and then silently leave. Also, time washes away the spots of their existence. However, what stays in the minds of the readers is the impacts of the transience of life and eternity of the tides. The rising signifies the beginning of life, and the falling tides signify the end of mortal life. nature is indifferent to the life of humans and when a human dies, nature still continues its cyclical pattern. In this case, the loss or potential death of the traveler has no effect on the natural pattern of the tide.  The tide rises, the tide falls,  The twilight darkens, the curlew calls;  Along the sea-sands damp and brown  The traveler hastens toward the town,  And the tide rises, the tide falls.  Darkness settles on roofs and walls,  But the sea, the sea in the darkness calls;  The little waves, with their soft, white hands,  Efface the footprints in the sands,  And the tide rises, the tide falls.  The morning breaks; the steeds in their stalls  Stamp and neigh, as the hostler calls;  The day returns, but nevermore  Returns the traveler to the shore,  And the tide rises, the tide falls.",

        "user_input": "The poem is narrated by Annabel Lee\u2019s lover, who forcefully rails against the people \u2014 and supernatural beings \u2014 who tried to get in the way of their love. Ultimately, the speaker claims that his bond with Annabel Lee was so strong that, even after her death, they are still together. It explores the depths of love and grief. The poem\u2019s speaker is distraught over the loss of his lover, to the point that he spends his nights sleeping in her tomb. The poem deals with the subject of pure love that remains even after the person whom you love is gone. It also clarifies the role of nature that separates the speaker from his beloved. The popularity of the poem lies in the fact that it represents love in its most pure form. love is the greatest force present in the universe and no power can destroy it; not even death. Although his beloved leaves the mortal world, he feels her presence all the time.  It was many and many a year ago,  In a kingdom by the sea,  That a maiden there lived whom you may know  By the name of Annabel Lee;  And this maiden she lived with no other thought  Than to love and be loved by me.  I was a child and she was a child,  In this kingdom by the sea,  But we loved with a love that was more than love \u2014  I and my Annabel Lee \u2014  With a love that the wing\u00e8d seraphs of Heaven  Coveted her and me.  And this was the reason that, long ago,  In this kingdom by the sea,  A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling  My beautiful Annabel Lee;  So that her highborn kinsmen came  And bore her away from me,  To shut her up in a sepulcher  In this kingdom by the sea.  The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,  Went envying her and me \u2014  Yes! \u2014 that was the reason (as all men know,  In this kingdom by the sea)  That the wind came out of the cloud by night,  Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.  But our love it was stronger by far than the love  Of those who were older than we \u2014  Of many far wiser than we \u2014  And neither the angels in Heaven above  Nor the demons down under the sea  Can ever dissever my soul from the soul  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;  And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side  Of my darling \u2014 my darling \u2014 my life and my bride,  In her sepulcher there by the sea \u2014  In her tomb by the sounding sea.",

        "user_input": "This poem is written by Robert Frost, a great American poet. The poem is about a young boy who loses his hand in an accident. The poem highlights what people feel about the young boy\u2019s passing and also death. The poet used references from Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth to compare the unpreparedness and shock of death. Death, child labor, and the fragility of life are the major themes of this poem. Robert Frost has highlighted the issue of child labor in this short poem. Although the boy performs man\u2019s tasks, he is still an innocent child at heart. The ending of the poem is callous, shocking, and cruel. People behave indifferently to the death of that boy. There are no signs of mourning or sadness on their faces. They return to their work as if nothing has happened. The message is the absurdity that is there in life. The beauty of life is also surrounded by similar cruelty. All of its end in the meaninglessness of death. This shows that life can be fast and quick like a candle, gone within a blink of an eye. When things go wrong such as death there is a time when your sad and devote your time to what has just happened but also you have to go on with your own lives and not let it interfere with what you have going on.  The buzz-saw snarled and rattled in the yard  And made dust and dropped stove-length sticks of wood,  Sweet-scented stuff when the breeze drew across it.  And from there those that lifted eyes could count  Five mountain ranges one behind the other  Under the sunset far into Vermont.  And the saw snarled and rattled, snarled and rattled,  As it ran light or had to bear a load.  And nothing happened: the day was all but done.  Call it a day, I wish they might have said  To please the boy by giving him the half-hour  That a boy counts so much when saved from work.  His sister stood beside him in her apron  To tell them \u2018Supper.\u2019 At the word, the saw,  As if to prove saws knew what supper meant,  Leaped out at the boy\u2019s hand, or seemed to leap \u2014  He must have given the hand. However, it was,  Neither refused the meeting. But the hand!  The boy\u2019s first outcry was a rueful laugh,  As he swung toward them holding up the hand  Half in appeal, but half as if to keep  The life from spilling. Then the boy saw all \u2014  Since he was old enough to know, big boy  Doing a man\u2019s work, though a child at heart \u2014  He saw all spoiled. \u2018Don\u2019t let him cut my hand off \u2014  The doctor, when he comes. Don\u2019t let him, sister!\u2019  So. But the hand was gone already.  The doctor put him in the dark of ether.  He lay and puffed his lips out with his breath.  And then \u2014 the watcher at his pulse took fright.  No one believed. They listened at his heart.  Little \u2014 less \u2014 nothing! \u2014 and that ended it.  No more to build on there. And they, since they  Were not the one dead, turned to their affairs.",
