    "user_input": "Do Dreams Actually Mean Anything? It Depends Who You Ask Theories they do Theories they don't Common dream meanings Interpreting your dreams Takeaway Psychologists, such as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, have long theorized on the deeper meaning of dreams. But other experts believe dreams don\u2019t have much meaning.  Nina Zivkovic/Stocksy United Some dreams slip away like minnows when you wake up and hazily try to grasp at them. Others remain vivid in your memory, so clear and unforgettable that, as the days pass, you might start to wonder if you actually dreamed them more than once.  Even if you don\u2019t remember many (or any) of your dreams, you do still have them. While experts still have plenty to discover about dreams, they do generally agreeTrusted Source that dreaming is part of the human experience.  You can cover a lot of ground in your dreams. Common experiences include:  sexy encounters with a crush ordinary activities, like doing chores or buying groceries terrifying experiences, like returning to high school or being chased by monsters gaining superpowers or magical abilities Whether your dreams are mundane or peculiar, you might want to know if they have any deeper significance. Experts haven\u2019t come up with a clear answer, but you\u2019ll find some main theories below \u2014 along with a few tips for decoding your own dreams.   Some experts think they do Plenty of psychologists and other experts have theorized on the deeper meaning of dreams.  Freud\u2019s theory of unconscious wish fulfillment Psychologist Sigmund Freud had a lot to say about dreams (and not all of it related to sex).  He suggested that dreams helped protect peopleTrusted Source from waking up early when light or sound disrupted their sleep, but he also believed dreams pointed to buried desires.  Your sleeping brain creates what he called a \u201cmanifest dream\u201d from snippets of everyday images, experiences, and memories. The manifest dream simplifies, reorganizes, and masks the \u201clatent dream,\u201d or your repressed and unconscious wishes.  In other words, the manifest dream uses various symbols and bizarre or unusual images to conceal the latent dream, or what you\u2019re really dreaming about.  Jung\u2019s theory of compensation and self-portrayal Like Freud, Carl Jung believed dreams had meaning. Jung focused on specific archetypes, or patterns, that appear symbolically in dreams, theorizing that dreams could help explain daily events and balance out aspects of yourself you aren\u2019t aware of yet.  Say, for example, you have a lighthearted relationship with your partner. You enjoy the same hobbies, have great sexual chemistry, and get along well \u2014 but you can\u2019t shake the feeling that something deeper\u2019s missing from your relationship.  One night, you dream the two of you are reviewing housing listings, wandering through the furniture section of a department store, and then, suddenly (in the abrupt nature of dreams), taking a leisurely walk through a quiet park.  Upon waking, you might realize your dream exposed some of the more mundane things absent in your relationship, while also suggesting you might want a relationship that includes thoughtful planning for the future along with fun.  Other key theories Other dream researchers have offered their own theories as to the meaning of dreams.  Psychologist Calvin S. Hall considered dreams part of the cognition process, or a type of thinking that happens as you sleep.  Since the images that appear in dreams reflect elements of daily life, Hall believed dreams could offer important insight into how you view yourself and others, your problems and conflicts, and the world in general.  Linguist and philosopher George Lakoff believed dreams offered a metaphorical glimpse into daily challenges and life events. In other words, the abstract symbols appearing in your dreams represent real hardships.  Psychologist and dream researcher Rosalind Cartwright also tied dreams to significant life events and emotional experiences. She believed dreams played an important role in cognitive processes, including memory and emotion regulation.  Professor G. William Domhoff also connected dreams to daily experiences. The things you do and think about during the day can resurface in dreams, he suggested, while your emotional mindset helps shape their unique content.  Domhoff also noted that, although dreams may shed some light on heavy concerns, they might not have any real purpose. You forget most of your dreams, after all.

    "user_input": "But others believe they don\u2019t Many experts don\u2019t believe dreams have much meaning, but believe they still serve a purpose.  Existing theories outline a few of these purposes.  Threat simulation theory Some researchers suggest that dreams serve an important evolutionary purpose.  According to threat simulation theory, dreams offer the chance to practice identifying, avoiding, and dealing with potential threats. By safely handling these threats in your dreams, you might feel safer in your waking life.  Research from 2009Trusted Source found some support for this theory by comparing dreams of children who had experienced trauma with children who hadn\u2019t.  Of course, threat simulation theory can also tie into other theories about dream meaning. Traumatized children could, for example, have more threatening dreams, because they often feel afraid in daily life.  Activation-synthesis theory According to the activation-synthesis theory, dreams are nothing more than a collection of random images and thoughts, projected during sleep as a result of normal brain activity.  These images don\u2019t follow any narrative structure, thanks to the pons, your brain\u2019s random dream generator. You create the story of your dream on your own, after waking up.  Supporters of this theory believe dreams can feel strange, because these random images often make little sense when they\u2019re combined.  Dreams as emotional regulation The unpleasant or unwanted emotions you experience in daily life can pop up in your dreams, too.  Anxiety, guilt, sadness, or fear can quickly get overwhelming. But some experts have theorized that navigating these feelings in dreamland can help you begin resolving these feelings without all the stress.  Wondering how that might work? Well, when you dream during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep, the parts of the brain that help regulate emotion and memory are active.  What\u2019s not active is the chemical messenger noradrenalineTrusted Source, which can produce feelings of anxiety or stress.  Continual-activation theory Your brain doesn\u2019t completely shut down when you go to sleep. Instead, it uses this time to carry out important processes, including transferring short-term memories into long-term storage.  As you sleep, your brain also takes out the trash, in a manner of speaking, by getting rid of all the leftover, unnecessary information.  As your unconscious brain focuses on processing memories, activity in your conscious brain slows way down.  According to the continual-activation theory, this prompts your brain to send a flow of data from memory storage into the conscious brain. You can think of this data \u2014 aka your dreams \u2014 as a sort of screensaver keeping the conscious part of your brain up and running, despite the lack of actual activity.",

    "user_input": "Common themes and their potential meanings No matter what scientific theories might suggest, people around the world have long believed in the significance of dreams and attempted to guess their meanings.  Dreams may seem so intriguing in part because they\u2019re not fully understood.

Here are some common dream themes, plus possible interpretations:  A dream about\tCould mean cheating on your partner\tyou\u2019re having a hard time getting your needs met in the relationship, or you feel trapped in another area of your life your partner cheating\tyou feel afraid of losing your partner or rejection in another area of life failing a test\tyou\u2019re facing some stress that you don\u2019t feel ready to handle being naked or experiencing other public embarrassment\tyou feel vulnerable and worry other people will notice your flaws discovering money or treasure\tyou feel confident, worthy, and good about yourself missing your bus or train\tyour everyday life leaves you frustrated and you believe you\u2019re lacking something important losing your teeth\tyou\u2019re worried about aging, or you have insecurities around how other people perceive you finding new rooms\tyou\u2019re discovering new abilities, interests, or future possibilities for yourself falling\tyou feel unsupported by loved ones, or as if you\u2019re losing control over some aspect of your life dying\tyou\u2019re facing some unwelcome changes or you have some uncertainties about the future",

    "user_input": "You\u2019re walking down a hazy road lined with antique streetlamps. The lights are glowing, faintly red, and splash pockets of color here and there along your path. The color begins to crawl out from under its given lamppost and all of the scenery becomes imbued, brushed in a singular hue of translucent rouge. Suddenly, you\u2019re startled by a gruff voice from behind\u2014oh, a German Shepherd, sitting at your feet. He speaks to you in a rhythmic bark ... A rhythmic bark. You awaken to the sound of the alarm clock and the sight of the warm morning sunlight.  It\u2019s not unusual to realize upon awakening that elements of our true physical surroundings have been incorporated into our dreams. Though we normally consider sleep to be a time when we are completely cut off from the real world, in fact, there continues to be a flow of input from our sensory systems, which may be fluidly incorporated into a dream. Of course, a strong enough stimulus would lead to an awakening, a fact that most of us take for granted when relying on an alarm clock.  Research on external incorporation into dreams has explored the influences of several different sensory systems, including touch, sight, and smell, on our nightly creations. Tactile experiments show that both pressure and temperature can influence the content of a dream. In a study conducted by Nielsen (1993), participants wore a pressure cuff on their leg while sleeping in the laboratory. During REM sleep, experimenters inflated the cuff to produce pressure on the leg and subsequently awoke participants for dream reports. The authors found several examples of leg pressure incorporated into dreams, sometimes in a subtle yet direct fashion (ie, tingling in the leg), and sometimes in a more elaborate fashion (ie, a dream sequence that involved paralysis of the leg, attempts to move the leg resulting in intense discomfort). Thus the physical sensation of pressure on the leg was incorporated in idiosyncratic ways, perhaps depending on the prior narrative of the dream or the quality of sleep.  In another niche of the dream field, researchers have made use of sensory stimuli as a tool for increasing lucidity. Many of the sleep masks marketed for lucid dreaming rely on blinking red lights that flash during REM sleep; these red lights appear within the dream, and clue the dreamer into the fact that they are actually sleeping. Successful users report seeing flashes of light in their dreams, for example \u201cI was walking along a road with my boss and the whole scene flashed, cueing me that I was dreaming. I mentioned it to him, and flew a little to prove it\u201d (subject dream report in LaBerge & Levitan, 1995). In this case, the users rely on a premeditated cue to trigger lucidity. Conceivably, other sensory signals, such as the pressure cuff, could similarly be used to induce lucid dreams.  One important question is just how much sensory stimuli is able to pierce through the barrier of sleep and into your dreams. Probably there are variations in sensitivity, similar to waking experience, where certain individuals are more aware of sensory quality and bodily sensation than others. An original project by Elizaveta Solomonova will explore sensory incorporations in the dreams of Vipassana meditators, a technique that focuses on awareness of body sensations. Funded by Mind and Life Institute, this project may reveal whether body-oriented contemplative practice alters embodied experience in dreams. In all cases, the impact of sensory stimuli on dreams suggests that the creation of dreams occurs as much in the body as it does in the mind, and underlines the role of the body in conscious experience.",

    "user_input": "From shores of ancient Bosphorus I write They appear in my inbox regularly, a couple times a year. I've grown accustomed to these clumsy, Google-Translated attempts at fraud and long stopped bothering to read them. But this time, when another message arrived via Facebook, I noticed something unusual\u2014it was written, inexplicably, in Turkish. The instantly translated text\u2014no longer via Google\u2014clearly bore the hallmarks of neural network craftsmanship. Admittedly, it handles language with far more diligence than I do. Plus, Turkey\u2014a pleasant geographical change of pace. Better than yet another message from Nigeria.  And then I remembered my favorite Stanis\u0142aw Lem novel\u2014The Investigation. In one episode, Ion Tichy amuses himself by making digital copies of consciousnesses\u2014Bertrand Russell's, someone else's, and Shakespeare's, I think\u2014chat with each other. My heart leaped with excitement. What had been pure science fiction in my parents' time had finally come to pass.  Just the other day, I even got a call from a recruiter offering me a job as an analyst. The role involved listening to dialogues between two neural networks about some topic or another\u2014and trying to figure out why their conversation veered in whatever direction it did. To dispel my suspicions that he\u2014this recruiter\u2014might himself be a program, he brought up some recent news item, declaring that since he could discuss it, he couldn\u2019t possibly be a bot. I confirmed that I believed he was human, given that his argument was obviously complete nonsense. Still, a lingering doubt remained\u2014and, I\u2019ll admit, a sliver of suspicion gnaws at me to this day.  So now, staring at this DM from a supposed Turkish bank employee\u2014something distinctly alive and even willing to engage in dialogue\u2014I decided the time had finally come to act and, like Ion Tichy, to plug something in somewhere, dump data into some system, lean back in my chair, and enjoy the results in the style of John Keats, mostly Byron, and\u2014for the grand finale\u2014Shakespeare. Just like in Lem's novel.  Mahadi Hasan:  From shores of ancient Bosphorus I write, Mahadi Hasan Fysun my name, a banker, destiny's guide. A tale I spin, of fortune's fading light, And kindred souls, across the world's wide tide.  Adrian Polski, of your land, now gone, In Istanbul, his golden trade he plied. Nine million dollars, sleeping, till the dawn, Deposited here, before his spirit sighed.  No kin he claimed, no loving hand to hold, Alone he passed, by cruel pandemic's sting. My bank knows not, their records yet unfold, A slumbering treasure, ripe for harvesting.  Our names, dear George, a whispered symphony, A chance encounter, woven by the Fates. I offer partnership, transparently, To claim this prize, before it dissipates.  Half shall be yours, a noble, rightful share, Legal protection, from all harm and fear. Let silence shroud us, as we take our share, Respond with haste, my friend, the hour is near.  George Polskiy:  That fate divine arranged our meeting, I have doubt, Though strange and wondrous paths our lives may tread. A banker from the Bosporus, devout, With tales of gold a long-dead soul has shed. Nine million dollars, quite a hefty clout, Unclaimed, forgotten, like a dream misled. You seek a partner, honest, just, and true, To share the spoils, a fifty-fifty view.  Alas, dear madam, your proposal grand, While tempting fate with promises untold, Falls flat upon this barren, weary land. My heart is cold, my pockets lined with mold. I've chased no fortune, joined no greedy band, Nor traded virtue for a *** of gold. Seek elsewhere, friend, for gullible kin. Mahadi Hasan, go to hell, I mean.  Mahadi Hasan:  Fear not, dear friend, I mean no treachery, My documents attest, this deal is pure and true, A transparent pact, beneath an open sky, And trust, the bridge we must together accrue. Though many share your name, my heart can spy, A noble spirit, one who sees this through. This fortune, like a blessing, will descend, Upon our houses, guided by my hand.  No legal labyrinth shall hinder our success, My bank, with parchment scrolls, shall make all plain, Ownership affirmed, before the funds progress, To your account, where not a doubt shall remain. Years spent in banking, grant me this finesse, The rules and systems, I perceive their grain. So trust my counsel, let no worry impede, The bond we forge, where mutual trust we breed.  George Polskiy:  You claim no fraud, dear madam, 'tis your plea, With documents galore, all legal and bright. Transparency, you say, our guide and glee, An umbrella of trust, to banish the night. My name is common, true, but you chose me, Guided by instinct, a beacon of light. Your trust I'll not disrupt, a soul so grand, This windfall's blessing, for yours and my hand.  But legal bridges, you say, hold no fright, A banker seasoned, with wisdom profound. Their rules and regulations he wields tight, No cause for worry on a solid ground. Yet trust, you see, is a fragile light, And promises whispered, is a hollow sound. So keep your millions and documents well, I will not sleep with devil. Go to hell.  Conclusion:  Hark, facebook stranger, lend thine eery ear, To this strange tale of greed and cunning art. A banker from the East, with whispers clear, Spins webs of deceit, to tear a soul apart.  With honeyed words and promises so grand, She lures her prey, a stranger from afar, With claims of kinship, and a helping hand, To steal a fortune, hidden in a jar.  But he, though tempted by such dazzling prize, Sees through her mask, her motives dark and low. He spurns her offer, with a knowing guise, And bids her seek a fool, where shadows grow.  For honesty and virtue hold more worth, Than ill-gained riches, stolen from the earth. #ai #scam #lem #turkey #nigeria #investigation #consciousness #science #bot",

    "user_input": "On August 28, 1963, some 100 years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves, a young man named Martin Luther King climbed the marble steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. to describe his vision of America. More than 200,000 people-black and white-came to listen. They came by plane, by car, by bus, by train, and by foot. They came to Washington to demand equal rights for black people. And the dream that they heard on the steps of the Monument became the dream of a generation.  As far as black Americans were concerned, the nation\u2019s response to Brown was agonizingly slow, and neither state legislatures nor the Congress seemed willing to help their cause along. Finally, President John F. Kennedy recognized that only a strong civil rights bill would put teeth into the drive to secure equal protection of the laws for African Americans. On June 11, 1963, he proposed such a bill to Congress, asking for legislation that would provide \u201cthe kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves.\u201d Southern representatives in Congress managed to block the bill in committee, and civil rights leaders sought some way to build political momentum behind the measure.  A. Philip Randolph, a labor leader and longtime civil rights activist, called for a massive march on Washington to dramatize the issue. He welcomed the participation of white groups as well as black in order to demonstrate the multiracial backing for civil rights. The various elements of the civil rights movement, many of which had been wary of one another, agreed to participate. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Racial Equality, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and the Urban League all managed to bury their differences and work together. The leaders even agreed to tone down the rhetoric of some of the more militant activists for the sake of unity, and they worked closely with the Kennedy administration, which hoped the march would, in fact, lead to passage of the civil rights bill.  On August 28, 1963, under a nearly cloudless sky, more than 250,000 people, a fifth of them white, gathered near the Lincoln Memorial in Washington to rally for \u201cjobs and freedom.\u201d The roster of speakers included speakers from nearly every segment of society \u2014 labor leaders like Walter Reuther, clergy, film stars such as Sidney Poitier and Marlon Brando and folksingers such as Joan Baez. Each of the speakers was allotted fifteen minutes, but the day belonged to the young and charismatic leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had originally prepared a short and somewhat formal recitation of the sufferings of African Americans attempting to realize their freedom in a society chained by discrimination. He was about to sit down when gospel singer Mahalia Jackson called out, \u201cTell them about your dream, Martin! Tell them about the dream!\u201d Encouraged by shouts from the audience, King drew upon some of his past talks, and the result became the landmark statement of civil rights in America \u2014 a dream of all people, of all races and colors and backgrounds, sharing in an America marked by freedom and democracy.  For further reading: Herbert Garfinkel, When Negroes March: The March on Washington\u2026(1969); Taylor Branch, Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963 (1988); Stephen B. Oates, Let the Trumpet Sound: The Life of Martin Luther King Jr. (1982). \u201cI HAVE A DREAM\u201d (1963)  I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of whithering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the colored America is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the colored American is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.  One hundred years later, the colored American lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the colored American is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.  In a sense we have come to our Nation\u2019s Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.  This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d  But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.  We have also come to his hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.  Now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.  Now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.  Now is the time to make justice a reality to all of God\u2019s children.  I would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it\u2019s colored citizens. This sweltering summer of the colored people\u2019s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the colored Americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.  There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  We cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person\u2019s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \u201cfor white only.\u201d  We cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in Mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.  No, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.  You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.  Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.  I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.  I have a dream that one day out in the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.  This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.  With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  This will be the day when all of God\u2019s children will be able to sing with new meaning \u201cMy country \u2019tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my father\u2019s died, land of the Pilgrim\u2019s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!\u201d  And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.  Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.  Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.  Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.  But not only that, let freedom, ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.  Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi and every mountainside.  When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\u2019s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old spiritual, \u201cFree at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.\u201d",

    "user_input": "dreaming can contribute to personal growth by aiding in memory consolidation, emotional processing, and problem-solving. Dreams can also serve as a form of emotional therapy, offering a safe space to explore and process unresolved feelings, potentially leading to self-awareness and growth.  Here's a more detailed look at how dreaming can contribute to growth: 1. Memory Consolidation and Learning: Dreams are believed to play a role in consolidating memories and transferring them from short-term to long-term storage.  During REM sleep, the brain can fuse and blend different memories, potentially leading to novel insights and creative problem-solving.  Dreams may also help the brain process and prepare for future events by \"replaying\" recent experiences.  2. Emotional Processing and Regulation: Dreams can provide a space to work through difficult emotions and experiences, potentially leading to emotional regulation and self-awareness.  Dreams can also serve as a form of emotional release, allowing individuals to confront suppressed feelings and gain perspective on challenging situations.  Lucid dreaming, where individuals are aware they are dreaming, can be used to explore and manage emotional content in a controlled environment.  3. Creativity and Problem-Solving: Dreams can enhance creativity by allowing the brain to explore abstract connections and develop novel ideas.  The abstract nature of dreams can help in identifying patterns and solutions to problems that might not be apparent in waking life.  Dreams can also serve as a source of inspiration for creative endeavors.  4. Self-Awareness and Personal Growth: By analyzing dream content, individuals can gain insights into their own thoughts, feelings, and motivations.  Recurring dream themes can provide clues about personal issues or unresolved conflicts that need attention.  Understanding dream symbolism can lead to greater self-awareness and personal growth.  In conclusion, while the exact mechanisms of dreaming and their impact on personal growth are still being researched, evidence suggests that dreams can be a valuable tool for processing emotions, consolidating memories, enhancing creativity, and promoting self-awareness.",

A mighty crew, and a great Captain too boot, they sent forth, looking for all the loot. By the age of nineteen, the Sailor saw a lot.  From drunken fights which ended with no love lost, to great bouts of strength between rivals a plenty, while losing not much, from great storms waged with such might, and lovely beauties who roamed the night.  Yet the Sailor was not happy, seeing the world was full of plenty, an ache for the soul, which left him to toil.  He set off at first light, without any worry nor fright, to look for an adventure, an Odyssey, and look for his own Penelope.  High and low he scoured, looking what his heart desired, even went to the countryside, for by chance his heart could reside, in need of desperate respite.  Yet he could not give in, to the trouble burrowed deep within, an ache he missed, a way out of the mist.  Once he came back he worried, what would they think or would they leave in a hurry? Just then the Captain saw him and said, \u201cThe sea is great, plenty of opportunity, so don\u2019t you worry, the sea holds aplenty.\u201d  And then he saw the Truth, to have such a crew, the mighty Captain too, is when he knew.  The sea in its eternal blue, holds many clues, for those who seek, amongst the wreckages, treasures can lie within different avenues, and still look for the great Muse. #journey #life #odyssey #dream #on",

    "user_input": "Rascal Does Not Dream of Falling in Love The weather seems alright, beautiful and uptight, Sweet with less avarice, an endless horizon, and a fleeting sight. In my world, she was the weather, I could do anything, but with her, I seem to do better. Nothing seemed impossible, not even venturing through the Nether. Effulgent was her presence; enticing, her nature, The talks kept getting better and better and better, It felt like the one we were looking for was here to savor.  Malicious and full of grief that once seemed as my future, Looked like a disoriented thought more than ever. I remember, Back in the day when I was wilding, Beautiful waves of comedic relief were a frequent sighting, I used to have fun and not fight, These demons, these thoughts that were always spouting, Restraining me since I always doubted (myself), But I knew there's always something, To get me started, I relinquished myself from ever doubting.  Nostalgic, Thought that would be the way to deal with such things, Big mistake! Because I got apprehended, Condescending, thoughts got crazy; nobody to talk to, baby. Misdirection, mazes of maybes, intercepting, decisions hazy, On second thought, this person's lazy.  Now in a field of darkness, so full of despair, I found you out of nowhere, A spark of light and a gasp for air, That's what I felt when my gaze landed upon you, That even I could prosper, even by the length of a hair. I was delighted for that came as a conclusion, For a long time, I hadn't smiled, but then I did, as if I were adhered, Sickeningly, any bond I form is doomed to fall, I fear, Regardless of how much I do, it's always a \"Too Sweet\" kind of dilemma, my dear, I don't easily love, but I loved you, even if it was due to my insecurities and issues, I state my mind clear, Kind of pointless to rant and yap to myself, writing paragraphs upon paragraphs, hoping you'd notice; clowning myself, makes me jeer, I guess that's how the story goes for a hopeless romantic expecting love to be simple as he was sincere.  With all these melodramatic events, I reckon he could really do some improv, One such thing is doing a show, but won't it be too rough? He might become yet another one to bite the dust, A victim of emotion, A victim of trust. Life's predicament is quite harsh and if not for his experience, he'd been lost, Though sounds drastic and revolting, Giving up can also be a sign of love, A hope for emotion, A hope for trust, Thus, this lousy \"Rascal doesn't dream of falling in love\u201d.",

    "user_input": "\u201c\u2018Are you dreaming?\u2019  \u201cThe question caught me off guard. I didn\u2019t recognize the voice. I turned to look at the man that questioned me. \u2018Excuse me?\u2019 As I turned I realized I wasn\u2019t able to focus on the man\u2019s face, but I knew it was there. I knew what it looked like, too, even though I couldn\u2019t make it out.  \u201cHe spoke to me again. \u2018You are dreaming aren\u2019t you? You made this?\u2019 He looked around at the boardwalk we were standing on. People walked passed us, unconcerned with our conversation.  \u201cI took a second to think about his question this time. I couldn\u2019t tell you what I was thinking about before he came up to me and, now that he brought it up, there was a certain oddness to the day. I looked down at the railing I was leaning on and felt it. The wood was old and rough, splintering beneath my fingers as I ran them slowly over it. This was too real to be a dream.  \u201cI looked back at the man. \u2018Why do you ask?\u2019  \u201c\u2018You were the only one looking at the waves.\u2019 I turned back to the beach. Nobody was on it. The man took a step toward me. \u2018Sir? Who am I?\u2019  \u201cI woke in my flat, transported from that distant place. I had to look and make sure it was the 4th. I was a little surprised that it was.  \u201cAnalysis: my dreams do indeed continue to get more vivid, to the point where they are almost indistinguishable from reality. I was approached last night. This man spoke to me but not with the typical reactive nature that most conversations in dreams consist of. He asked me questions. He asked me an existential question. I don\u2019t know the meaning of this or its significance.\u201d  I closed out of the dream journal and thought on the subject for a while. Perhaps my subconscious was just creating more vivid and realistic worlds. I decided to stop dwelling on nonsense and start the day. I looked out the window at the January snow falling to the streets below.  I walked out of the room past the magnetic shielding to continue my work. The capacitors in the nanobots residing in my brain allowed for twenty minutes of operation outside of the magnetic field. Every twenty minutes I would take a break and go back into my bedroom\u2019s B-field and recharge. I was working on a solution for that problem.  That work got easier every day. The nanobots increased the connections between my neurons and the artificial electrodes. I was the only person with the means and will to attempt intelligence amplification, and little by little, I was becoming the most intelligent person the planet had ever seen. The computer power of my brain in just the early stages of my development already far surpassed anything anyone had seen.  I was working on a new generation of nanobots that would be powered by the electrolytes in my blood. This would take away my need to be tethered to my flat and the magnetic field inside. I could go back down onto the streets and walk around. I was originally going to use a piezoelectric membrane on the nanobots and pump ultrasound into my brain. But that was before I had my upgraded prefrontal cortex and was able to make electrolyte-powered nanos possible.  \u201cI found him again. I was able to find the same boardwalk. The dreams are getting longer as my computing power increases; it felt like I waited for days on that beach. I\u2019m looking at the data now and yes, it was equivalent to six days. After all that time on the beach he finally approached me from behind, just as he did the first time.  \u201c\u2019Are you dreaming?\u2019  \u201cIt had been days. I had given up on seeing him again, so the second time caught me off guard as well. I turned around to the voice. \u2018Excuse me?\u201d As soon as I saw him I recognized him. He had soft, hazel eyes and brown hair, something I only knew before but could see now. He stood up tall like he was forcing himself to do so, like he was mustering up the courage to talk to a childhood hero and putting on a brave face.  \u201c\u2018You are dreaming aren\u2019t you? You made this?\u201d  \u201c\u2018Yes, I think I did. You want to know who you are. So do I. Tell me about yourself.\u2019  \u201c\u2018Yes sir. I live in that house over there.\u2019 He pointed to a house just beyond the boardwalk. \u2018I like to watch the waves. You\u2019re the only other person that does.\u2019  \u201c\u2018I was waiting for you.\u2019  \u201c\u2018Me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018Is this the first time you\u2019ve spoken to me?\u2019  \u201c\u2018Yes sir. It took me a few days to work up the courage.\u2019 Shame seemed to subtly slide across his face as he admitted that.  \u201c\u2018Do you have a name?\u2019  \u201c\u2018A name, sir?\u2019  \u201cAnd then I woke. The bastard wasted too much time working up his courage. Again I had to look at the window and make sure it was April 11th. Indeed only one night had passed.  \u201cAnalysis: definite hints of emotions and sentience.\u201d  I got out of bed and readied for the day. It was my biweekly adventure down the tower and into civilization.  The puddles splashed beneath my feet as I walked the two blocks to the store. People snapped pictures of me as I passed them on the sidewalk, but I paid them no mind. Being amongst them was as good as interaction for me. I would try to keep my sustenance gathering to as close to twenty minutes as possible. I couldn\u2019t afford to lose any time on my progress. Rather, I didn\u2019t want to. I made it quick and grabbed the essentials. Whatever I missed could be acquired by an assistant and brought to the top of the tower.  \u201cAs I progress, the dreams are more frequently playing like simulations that I observe rather than participate in. They are still impossibly long. I watched a family live their lives for years last night. The dreams appear to be growing by a few percentage points per day as the nanobots increase the neurological connections.  \u201cThis brings in to question the ethics of my undertaking in to amplified intelligence. These beings in my dreams are clearly sentient, albeit simple, creatures. They question their existence and meaning. When I wake, their simulation ceases, and with it so does their existence. I give them life and then take it away.  \u201cBut all in all, they are an annoying byproduct of my goals. They would have no existence at all without me. I shall have no more empathy for them.  \u201cAs electrolyte-powered nanobots near printing, I am ready to integrate the BASCS supercomputer system into my nervous system. Coupling my brain with BASCS will give me an astronomical amount of computing power. I don\u2019t know what life will be like after.\u201d  Time is irrelevant there is only information.  \u201cI have awoken for the first time since being coupled with the BASCS. Much like before, my dreams ran like simulations, but this time on massive proportions. The shear amount of data collected has been enormous. I have run a simulation of an entire universe, although much simpler than the one we live in.  \u201cThe simulation began with an instant introduction of space and energy. Quite literally astronomical amounts of space and energy. Energy condensed into particles, particles condensed into atoms, atoms condensed into galaxies filled with star systems.  \u201cI believe my subconscious guided the simulation. The reason I believe this is because life only formed in one of these countless star systems, and, as it evolved, many of the species that arose exist here in the real world. Including us. They were by far the most fascinating things to come out of this simulation, this dream.  \u201cWhole civilizations arose. They were self-questioning, inquisitive, inventive. They called themselves man, human, or homo sapiens and their planet on which they lived Earth. I could interact with them, but I enjoyed observing from afar.  \u201cThey discovered much about their universe. Even to the point where their instruments could see to smaller levels than my simulation\u2019s physics could allow for. Their work was admirable but now I am awake, and they are nothing.\u201d  I stood up and walked out of the B-field into the lab. I deleted the plans for the electrolyte nanobots waiting to be printed. And watched the first snow of the winter fall onto the streets below.",

    "user_input": "Life will challenge you \u2014 physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. This poem calls out for you to endure, keep going through, and rise above the adversity you will face. It inspires, it motivates, it provides an example to follow. It\u2019s like a recipe for life \u2014 and it provides a most satisfying meal. It is an inspirational poem that provides advice on how one should live one\u2019s life. The poem takes the reader through various ways in which the reader can rise above adversity that will almost certainly be thrown one\u2019s way at some point in one\u2019s lives. The poet conveys his ideas about how to win this life, and after all, how to be a good human being. Risks must be taken into life and hopes must not be lost if things do not work out as the desired way. Eventually, the poet implied once people have reached success which they aimed at, they should remain to mingle with the common crowd but never lose his individuality.  If you can keep your head when all about you  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,  But make allowance for their doubting too;  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,  Or being lied about, don\u2019t deal in lies,  Or being hated, don\u2019t give way to hating,  And yet don\u2019t look too good, nor talk too wise:  If you can dream \u2014 and not make dreams your master;  If you can think \u2014 and not make thoughts your aim;  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  And treat those two impostors just the same;  If you can bear to hear the truth you\u2019ve spoken  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  And stoop and build \u2019em up with worn-out tools:  If you can make one heap of all your winnings  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  And lose, and start again at your beginnings  And never breathe a word about your loss;  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  To serve your turn long after they are gone,  And so hold on when there is nothing in you  Except the Will which says to them: \u2018Hold on!\u2019  If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  Or walk with Kings \u2014 nor lose the common touch,  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  If all men count with you, but none too much;  If you can fill the unforgiving minute  With sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run,  Yours is the Earth and everything that\u2019s in it,  And \u2014 which is more \u2014 you\u2019ll be a Man, my son!",

    "user_input": "Life is made up of a succession of choices. This famous poem begins at a fork in a wooded path and ushers the reader along one \u201croad\u201d as a means of explaining that we must choose one way or another and not dilly-dally in life. No matter which way we go, we cannot foresee where it will take us, nor how the other would have turned out. We can do our best to make good decisions, but we\u2019ll never truly know how much worse or better an alternative might have been. And so, we mustn\u2019t regret the road not taken. The Road Not Taken\u201d is an ambiguous poem that allows the reader to think about choices in life, whether to go with the mainstream or go it alone. If life is a journey, this poem highlights those times in life when a decision has to be made. The speaker spends a while deliberating when he comes to a fork in the road, which symbolizes a choice he must make in his life.  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  And sorry I could not travel both  And be one traveler, long I stood  And looked down one as far as I could  To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair,  And having perhaps the better claim,  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  Though as for that the passing there  Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay  In leaves, no step had trodden black.  Oh, I kept the first for another day!  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh  Somewhere ages and ages hence:  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I \u2014  I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.",

    "user_input": "This rhyming poem is the spark that can reignite the fires within you. It challenges you to go out and live your life in the present moment as a \u201chero\u201d and leave your mark on this world. \u201cA Psalm of Life\u201d by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow describes the purpose of life, and how one should handle the sorrow and struggles along the way. Throughout the poem, he intends to encourage the readers and urges them not to let the precious moments of life go in vain. He instructs them to keep a balance between happiness and sorrows and carve a better future for themselves. we should not spend our priceless moments sitting idly and doing nothing, rather we have to work hard towards reaching our goal and to make the most out of this short life.  Act! Take Action! Be Active!  Tell me not, in mournful numbers,  Life is but an empty dream!  For the soul is dead that slumbers,  And things are not what they seem.  Life is real! Life is earnest!  And the grave is not its goal;  Dust thou art, to dust returnest,  Was not spoken of the soul.  Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,  Is our destined end or way;  But to act, that each to-morrow  Find us farther than to-day.  Art is long, and Time is fleeting,  And our hearts, though stout and brave,  Still, like muffled drums, are beating  Funeral marches to the grave.  In the world\u2019s broad field of battle,  In the bivouac of Life,  Be not like dumb, driven cattle!  Be a hero in the strife!  Trust no Future, however pleasant!  Let the dead Past bury its dead!  Act, \u2014 act in the living Present!  Heart within, and God o\u2019erhead!  Lives of great men all remind us  We can make our lives sublime,  And, departing, leave behind us  Footprints on the sands of time;  Footprints, that perhaps another,  Sailing o\u2019er life\u2019s solemn main,  A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,  Seeing shall take heart again.  Let us, then, be up and doing,  With a heart for any fate;  Still achieving, still pursuing,  Learn to labor and to wait.",

    "user_input": "\u201cStill I Rise\u201d by Maya Angelou  \u201cThe first time I read this poem I was still a young girl, trying to figure out who I was and frankly what the hell was happening to my body. Maya Angelou made me feel like who I was becoming \u2014 a woman \u2014 was something very special, ancient, and wonderful. I physically remember breathing out and sitting up just a little bit taller because of her words. \u201cStill I Rise\u201d is an empowering poem about the struggle to overcome prejudice and injustice. It is one of Maya Angelou\u2019s most popular poems. When read by victims of wrongdoing, the poem becomes a kind of anthem, a beacon of hope for the oppressed and downtrodden. It is a reminder of the abuse of power by those who sit in government, the judiciary, the military, and the police force. For members of the public, it sends out the clear, repeated message of hope. No matter the circumstances, there must always be hope to cling to. Courage, pride, and injustice are some of the major themes crafted in the poem. The poet speaks about the biting criticism of dark skin in society. Also, she details how people want to kill them with hatefulness. But, the speaker is really proud of her identity, which she expresses in various ways in the text. She openly challenges those who want to hold her down. Instead of wallowing in stress and fear, she aims to live a happy and confident life.  You may write me down in history  With your bitter, twisted lies,  You may trod me in the very dirt  But still, like dust, I\u2019ll rise.  Does my sassiness upset you?  Why are you beset with gloom?  \u2019Cause I walk like I\u2019ve got oil wells  Pumping in my living room.  Just like moons and like suns,  With the certainty of tides,  Just like hopes springing high,  Still, I\u2019ll rise.  Did you want to see me broken?  Bowed head and lowered eyes?  Shoulders falling down like teardrops,  Weakened by my soulful cries?  Does my haughtiness offend you?  Don\u2019t you take it awful hard  \u2019Cause I laugh like I\u2019ve got gold mines  Diggin\u2019 in my own backyard.  You may shoot me with your words,  You may cut me with your eyes,  You may kill me with your hatefulness,  But still, like air, I\u2019ll rise.  Does my sexiness upset you?  Does it come as a surprise  That I dance like I\u2019ve got diamonds  At the meeting of my thighs?  Out of the huts of history\u2019s shame  I rise  Up from a past that\u2019s rooted in pain  I rise  I\u2019m a black ocean, leaping and wide,  Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.  Leaving behind nights of terror and fear  I rise  Into a daybreak that\u2019s wondrously clear  I rise  Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,  I am the dream and the hope of the slave.  I rise  I rise  I rise.",

    "user_input": "20 Years In Space   She comes to me in pieces as I watch the stillness of space, envisioning new constellations in the array of unrecognized stars. I trace the sparks of light with my finger, connecting the dots and smudging the glass as a result.\u00a0\u00a0 How many stars do you think there are in space?\u00a0I imagine her asking.\u00a0Can there really be other ones out there as big as or even bigger than the sun?\u00a0 I always admired her genuine curiosity, how she viewed things with a particular interest, how she saw me. She was the one that organized our sleepovers, the one that nudged me to sign up for afterschool activities such as the chemistry club and the robotics team.\u00a0\u00a0 Can you build me a mechanical arm that'll change the channels on the TV's remote, so that way I don't have to? She once asked sarcastically.\u00a0How about a drone that we can use transport food from the fridge up to the treehouse, huh? Wouldn't that be neat?\u00a0 When we were kids, I would give her piggyback rides and we\u2019d run through the sprinklers across watery arches with captured rainbows. We'd go back home, and my mother would scold us while our shivering bodies shared a single towel, and in the end, she'd shine me a blue-lipped smile with her crooked teeth. That was fun, wasn't it?\u00a0\u00a0 Our childhood adventures involved trips to the public pool, wet t-shirts, and popsicles mucking up our fingers under the August sun. She'd take me to her soccer team's practices, and I'd watch her run up and down while I built rovers and complex constructs out of legos on the bleachers. Booyah!\u00a0She'd shout after scoring a goal. I'd cheer or clap, and she would always gleam and say the same thing.\u00a0Goooooooaaaaallllll. And that's how the west was won. A few years later, our tastes matured, slipping our summers into memories and substituting them for funky clothing and car rides on the empty freeway. She and I would stop on the roadsides by green fields that looked blue under the night sky. We'd sit under the blanket of stars and watch the moon while dreaming up our futures after high school.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm going to apply for a sports scholarship and get the fuck out of this town,\u00a0she'd always say.\u00a0How about you? I don't know.\u00a0I shrugged.\u00a0Maybe I'll go work with my dad as an apprentice at his accounting firm. What? Come on, you got to apply for university too. You're a freakin brainiac. I'm sure you could get into any school. Out the bay window, I see the lunar triplets:\u00a0Euphrosyne, Aglia,\u00a0and\u00a0Nathalia\u00a0dancing around what the New Worlds Association likes to call\u00a0Undine, the flooded, blue planet, equivalent in size to Jupiter, that I've been studying for what would be measured, on planet Earth, as eight months.\u00a0 The journey to this specific star system took four years. The rest of the crew and I have enough resources to last another sixteen\u00a0Earth\u00a0months. By then, we'll have made a substantial dent in our research. Our food, water, fuel, along with our tolerance for the presence of one another, will have depleted, and we'll go into cryosleep for our return. A decade, that's how long we'll have been apart.\u00a0 So you'll be asleep, frozen in a coffin for about eight years?\u00a0 I assured her that it was completely safe, that I wouldn't die in transport.\u00a0 But doesn't that mean that you'll come back looking almost the same as when you left? Won't you technically be younger than me? I think about her current age. How it's already been more than 8 years, and how unfair it must have seemed to her; that she'd miss me in the entirety of all that elapsed time while I'd be sleeping almost all the years away, except for two.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes I wonder if she tells her other friends and customers about me.\u00a0My buddy's up in space,\u00a0I imagine her saying.\u00a0What's he doing up there? He's researching a new planet, someplace better than this shit hole we're destroying.\u00a0 Undine\u00a0registers an oxygen signature similar to Europa and planet Earth. The oceanic surface covering the entire planet could host a form of phytoplankton or an entirely new plant species capable of producing oxygen as a byproduct of their natural photosynthetic process. In other words,\u00a0Undine\u00a0could, in theory, host life.\u00a0 If I'm being honest with myself, sometimes I feel that my role on this ship isn't as relevant as the other crew members' works. That perhaps what I'm doing isn't as impacting, that it's less exciting. I'm not spacewalking or trying to merge chemical compounds under zero-gravity conditions. I barely passed the physical exam, and my score on the simulatory emergency program ranked me as the fifth in command if anything were to happen to our pilot or the others of my crew.\u00a0\u00a0 So what?\u00a0She'd fire out.\u00a0You'll still be one of the few guys part of the human race to have ever gone up to space. You'll still have broken records, be mentioned in the history books. You'll have gone places no one has ever been to.\u00a0 \u00a0 It was always like her to see the bright side in situations. When she didn't get her full-ride to college, she applied for the town's undergrad program at the local college.\u00a0Don't worry, hun, I'm still going to make it back and get myself out of this place. When she couldn't juggle both her academic life and work to help her folks pay the bills, she still didn't crumble under all the pressure.\u00a0I'll take a break this semester, and then on the next one, I'll go back.\u00a0 She never returned to school to finish her undergrad.\u00a0Maybe college just isn't for me.\u00a0She opted to continue working, helping out her folks, and eventually went to, and finished, trade school.\u00a0I'm thinking about opening a restaurant.\u00a0She told me years ago.\u00a0What about you, what are you thinking about doing with your life, huh, Mr. Big Shot Imma certified scientist? I laughed at her remark.\u00a0I don't know,\u00a0I answered.\u00a0I guess I could teach or go for my Ph.D. What? But you just finished school, now you're thinking about going back?\u00a0She commented while scratching her head. She tugged on the bill of her baseball cap and shook her head in disapproval.\u00a0You're nuts, homeboy!\u00a0 Yeah? And what do you think I should do? If I were as wicked smart as you, I'd go to the moon! Scientists are some of the professionals that, depending on their branch of specialization, are often courted by big-money tech companies and international organizations. She heard about a space program from one of her faithful customers, a man that worked as a research assistant for the state university who always ordered a bear claw with a large cup of coffee and a BLT for the road. She told me how the New Worlds Association was looking for people to\u00a0blast off, in her own words, into space. That the money I'd receive would leave me set for life.\u00a0\u00a0 She was the one that showed me the association's website.\u00a0It says here you have to send them a paper or something explaining your qualifications, along with an idea for a project applicable in space, highlighting a specific area of research. Does that sound like something you could do? Huh?\u00a0I was distracted at first by the site's banner, a rocket blasting off into the moon, pointing like an arrowhead to the unknown.\u00a0I think so,\u00a0I answered, correcting myself.\u00a0But \u2014 But what if I get accepted? That's what I should have asked.\u00a0But what if they don't think I'm qualified enough? What if I'm rejected? Then they're crazy,\u00a0she snapped back.\u00a0You're the most intelligent person I know! No way, they'd reject you.\u00a0 I pitched her my project several times, letting her serve as my judge and jury. The idea was simple, build a compact, remote-operated device that could probe the oceanic planet of\u00a0Undine.\u00a0 Do you mean like a robotic hand? Exactly, think of it like a hand that's also like a drone,\u00a0I said.\u00a0A machine that could enter the planet and try to collect data on whether there are any living organisms present in the planet's aquatic terrain or not. If the scan is positive, it'll extract several samples for me and the crew. Some of these samples can undergo analysis and testing while in space, and others could be stored in a controlled environment on the spacecraft and transported back home with us.\u00a0 She stared at me for a few seconds, her eyes wide and her mouth nearly dangling from her jaw like a bell.\u00a0 So...what do you think? I think you're going into space.\u00a0 The admiration in her eyes was stunning and had me gleaming like a young boy.\u00a0Who knows, maybe we'll even stop by the moon on our return? The probe,\u00a0Michaelangelo, named by myself, will enter\u00a0Undine's\u00a0domain in approximately two weeks. From our current distance, the device's descent will take anywhere from two to three days. That's when my mission will reach its zenith and when things could get dicey. I'll have to watch over\u00a0Michaelangelo\u00a0as if it's a newborn child learning to swim. I'll also have to frequently analyze\u00a0Undine's\u00a0tidal patterns and climate while observing the incoming data as soon as\u00a0Michaelangelo\u00a0departs from the spacecraft. Do you think Michaelangelo will make it out of that place in one piece?\u00a0She asked with a worried expression as if the probe was a living creature, a pet cat or dog. I think so. I'm working with a pretty big budget, and it'll be made exclusively for the mission. Knowing you'll be the one to build him, I'm sure he'll be great! No, I'm wrong. Michaelangelo\u00a0will be better than great. He'll be fucking perfect.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm glad one of us is feeling confident,\u00a0I returned, leaning back into her sofa. She plopped himself right beside me, threw her arm over my neck, and pulled me into her orbit with such savagery that we ended up rolling onto the floor. She flipped herself over, partially resting her chest over mine,\u00a0don't be so hard on yourself. I believe in you. I'll miss you, you know that, right?\u00a0I gushed. We hadn't talked about the possibility of my leaving, camouflaging the void that would be left behind with excitement and speculation. My eyes at that moment reddened, burned much like they always do whenever I think of her. Hey, it'll be a good opportunity for you, won't it? You'll be doing something you're good at, something that could help everyone back here on planet Earth.\u00a0\u00a0 Onboard the spaceship, there's a mechanic who's responsible for repairs and keeping the ship functioning, who sometimes also gets the chance to soar like an acrobat in the depths of space. We have a medic doing research on the proliferation of diseases under low gravity conditions.\u00a0 They all sound like show-offs, that's what!\u00a0 There's also a physicist and a botanist. Our pilot's one of the few men to have traveled multiple times to the moon and Mars, as well as a skilled photographer who captured high-definition photos of cosmic dust clouds, and then there's me, a certified scientist, as she'd like to say.\u00a0 A certified scientist who won himself a round trip ticket to space.\u00a0 Weeks before my leave, we were lying close to one another in a field of dark-blue grass.\u00a0You're going to do big things up there,\u00a0she said. She turned and shined me her crooked smile.\u00a0And when you're back, everyone is going to know your name.\u00a0 You know I don't care about any of that stuff. I'm much more interested in seeing the planet with the three moons. I swear, love, only you.\u00a0\u00a0 Everyone here talks about their projects, comments on how much they miss their family. Our captain left his wife three months pregnant back home, our mechanic and our medic, two kids each. When they turn to me and ask if I've left anything important behind, the first person that comes to mind isn't my mother or father, a house or a car; it's her.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm the quiet one up here. Space is already deathly silent, but it and I enter into staring contests with each other through the bay window, my eyes versus\u00a0Undine's\u00a0three moons. I watch them, the triplets that grace the aquatic planet, drawing up conclusions as to what might occur if one of the lunar bodies were to simply explode. Obviously, there'd be no sound, but I'd watch the floating remnants, mesmerized by the rubble as if catching the sight of fallen snow. In this particular star system, aside from all the planets and moons spread out across the field of space, there's also a bright celestial body similar to the sun back home. The lone star is distant from everything, the same way that I'm years away from my planet and from the only person more important to me than anything in the whole universe.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 How do you think things will be like once I'm back?\u00a0I asked her before I left for my physical and mental training.\u00a0 What do you mean?\u00a0She returned.\u00a0 Will we still be \u2014 You're kidding, right? Come on, I know you're smarter than that.\u00a0 She hugged me, and for a moment, I wished she had begged me not to go. I considered the idea of staying, of resisting the money, and even the chance to see the moon.\u00a0 Promise me you'll be here when I get back. I wouldn't dream of leaving this place without you. I'll be here waiting for you. Me, and this planet with nothing but a single moon.\u00a0 At times I question myself.\u00a0What's so great about a planet that's essentially all water and almost no detectable land?\u00a0And I'll hear her saying how we could build floating houses or architectural structures like the Maldives, or that we can bring out a boat from Earth just like Noah's Ark and spend our days searching the blue world for a paradisiac island.\u00a0Who knows, maybe we could even live in underwater domes like The Atlanteans? I'll nod and chuckle to myself and say\u00a0sure\u00a0as if it's all so simple. I'll picture us both on\u00a0Undine\u00a0drifting together in its never-ending pool. She and I, in our own private world, where we'll swim in our t-shirts and play with\u00a0Michaelangelo.\u00a0 Before I left, She gave me an envelope,\u00a0open it only once you're far away from\u00a0Earth.\u00a0It's because of what she wrote that I know I'll return, that I'll tell her everything, from what I saw to what I dreamt. I'll say how much I remembered, how much I missed her, and I'll repeat the exact verse she wrote at the end of her letter; three words more significant to me than\u00a0Undine\u00a0and its three moons.",

It was so subtle that the nimble verdant limbs trembled in response, Mimicking the soothing sound of a seashore.

Its light kisses your pale skin, infused with melanin, \u2028 And toasts you to a perfect shade of cinnamon.  You can feel the excitement of vacation coursing through your veins, Rising and falling with each breath. If you..shhh, calm down, and relax, You can experience the weightlessness of shedding a world\u2019s burden from your stubborn shoulders. There\u2019s life in this moment, even in the comfort of your own backyard.  Listen to the songbirds\u2019 cheerful chirps And the playful chatter of chipmunks scurrying along. But resist the urge to open your eyes and embrace the present moment. Live in a dreamlike state, where you can savor the taste of freedom. How it tastes like silk and watermelon, or lemon lime, sublime This moment has the power to transform your life, Banishing the harmful cancers of sadness that have plagued you. No more today, when you bask in the sun\u2019s rays, feeling a renewed pep in your step And confidence in your sway. As the day unfolds, the rain clouds may roll in tomorrow, but not today. It is beautiful outside, and I think we are too quick to take it for granted, but there are moments where you can carve out those tiny bits of peace for yourself. #peace #harmony #sunlight #life",

And as he entered the dark room A new hallucination entered his mind like a liar He turned to leave, but the door was locked And he was trapped in with the fire. this was my 44th poem, written on 11/9/23.

Not the true-crime shows that kept you up in morbid curiosity, Anticipation and cynicism you couldn\u2019t help but chase like Pandora\u2019s box, A price you paid with the death of childhood ignorance. Not the hours you spent trying to delude yourself into forgetting, Trying to bring the fantasy worlds in your fictions to life as a distraction, Only for them to be tainted by the blood of your supposed savior, Not the nights you woke up in the purgatory of consciousness held down by restraints, Inescapable regardless of how much you tried to urge your muscle nerves to just move; You broke the rules - your mind your prison, something you could sense but would never truly understand. You were born to live an unfulfilled life, Half of you chasing comfort in the warmth of the radiating body in the sky, Only for the other to seek its death - to watch a being of vast power, provider of light, devolve into infinite darkness - emptiness warping space and time, void of destruction. You\u2019ve been here before, sat in front of fate dealing her cards, Only for her to reveal the fool, just like she had the last time, and the time before that. Regret none of it, not one of the countless sleepless nights you\u2019ve endured, Not one of the days you walked through the world with your vision spinning, Permanently blinded by the haze that stood between you and affirmation. You\u2019ve been blessed with a beautiful gift, so relax. Don\u2019t bother thinking about escaping the fog, The way that it consumes your mind with unanswerable questions, An uncontrollable desire to chase against your rationale.

It's a form of self-reflection and exploration, often involving questions about your past, present, and future, as well as your place in the world.  Here's a more detailed look at what it can entail: Self-inquiry: Wondering about yourself can involve questioning your beliefs, values, and life goals.  Identity exploration: It can lead to a deeper understanding of who you are, including your personality, strengths, weaknesses, and potential.  Questioning the status quo: Wondering can challenge assumptions and encourage you to think critically about your experiences and the world around you.  Seeking meaning and purpose: It can be a way of searching for a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in your life.  Growth and development: Wondering can be a catalyst for personal growth, as it encourages you to explore new possibilities and perspectives.  Emotional processing: It can be a way of processing emotions, both positive and negative, and understanding their impact on your life.  Expanding consciousness: Wonder can lead to a heightened state of awareness and a greater appreciation for the complexities of life.",

It did not rush, it did not break, It bloomed when time was sure to take. A lesson whispered through the air\u2014 Some things must wait to grow so fair.  The soil cradles the seed, the seed cradles a secret.  It knows it can bloom. Knows the sun will greet it, the rain will nourish it, the bees will come.  Yet still, it waits.  Because blooming is not just survival\u2014 it is choosing to step into the light. #seeds #bloom #nourish #growth #becoming",

    "user_input": "The feeling you experience when hearing the word \"dream\" likely stems from personal associations and experiences with dreams, rather than a universal biological response to the word itself. The brain's processing of language and the connections it forms with our memories and emotions can create these unique reactions.  Here's a more detailed breakdown:  Personal Memories and Associations: . You may have vivid and emotional memories associated with specific types of dreams, like lucid dreams or dreams that were particularly unsettling or joyful. Hearing \"dream\" can trigger those memories and associated emotions. Dreaming and Sleep: . The word \"dream\" is directly linked to the concept of dreaming, a natural and often fascinating state of sleep. This link can evoke a feeling of wonder, curiosity, or even a sense of the unknown. Symbolic Meaning: . Your brain may interpret the word \"dream\" as a symbol, and this symbol can evoke a range of emotions depending on your individual experiences and interpretations. Emotional Responses: . Dreams themselves can trigger strong emotional responses, and the act of remembering and reflecting on them can also evoke feelings. The word \"dream\" can be a trigger for these emotional memories. In essence, the feeling you experience is likely a combination of your personal history with dreams, the emotional weight you place on them, and the way your brain processes the language and its associated meanings.",
