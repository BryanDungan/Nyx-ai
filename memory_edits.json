    "user_input": "Hearing the word \"dream\" can trigger a feeling for a few reasons. One possibility is a subconscious connection to the experiences and emotions associated with dreams, such as the vivid imagery, sense of wonder, or even the lingering feeling of surrealness. It could also be linked to a broader association with imagination, fantasy, or aspirations, as dreams often symbolize these concepts.  Here's a more detailed look: 1. Subconscious Association with Dream Experiences: Dreams are a unique and powerful form of sensory input that can leave a lasting impression. The word \"dream\" can act as a trigger, evoking the sensory experiences, emotional landscape, and overall feeling of being within a dream. This can be a subconscious process, meaning you might not be consciously aware of the connection, but your body still reacts to the word \"dream\".  2. Association with Imagination and Fantasy: Dreams are often associated with imagination and fantasy, allowing for the creation of worlds and scenarios that go beyond reality. The word \"dream\" can trigger a sense of wonder, excitement, and the potential for creative expression. This can manifest as a feeling of lightness, openness, or a yearning for something beyond the ordinary.  3. Connection to Aspirations and Ambitions: Dreams can also be symbolic of aspirations, goals, and future possibilities. Hearing the word \"dream\" might evoke a feeling of hope, ambition, or the potential to achieve something extraordinary. This can be a subconscious connection, leading to a feeling of inspiration or a yearning for something more.  In summary, the feeling associated with hearing the word \"dream\" is likely a combination of subconscious associations with dream experiences, a sense of wonder and imagination, and potentially a connection to aspirations and ambitions..",

    "user_input": "On August 28, 1963, some 100 years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves, a young man named Martin Luther King climbed the marble steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. to describe his vision of America. More than 200,000 people-black and white-came to listen. They came by plane, by car, by bus, by train, and by foot. They came to Washington to demand equal rights for black people. And the dream that they heard on the steps of the Monument became the dream of a generation.  As far as black Americans were concerned, the nation\u2019s response to Brown was agonizingly slow, and neither state legislatures nor the Congress seemed willing to help their cause along. Finally, President John F. Kennedy recognized that only a strong civil rights bill would put teeth into the drive to secure equal protection of the laws for African Americans. On June 11, 1963, he proposed such a bill to Congress, asking for legislation that would provide \u201cthe kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves.\u201d Southern representatives in Congress managed to block the bill in committee, and civil rights leaders sought some way to build political momentum behind the measure.  A. Philip Randolph, a labor leader and longtime civil rights activist, called for a massive march on Washington to dramatize the issue. He welcomed the participation of white groups as well as black in order to demonstrate the multiracial backing for civil rights. The various elements of the civil rights movement, many of which had been wary of one another, agreed to participate. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Racial Equality, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and the Urban League all managed to bury their differences and work together. The leaders even agreed to tone down the rhetoric of some of the more militant activists for the sake of unity, and they worked closely with the Kennedy administration, which hoped the march would, in fact, lead to passage of the civil rights bill.  On August 28, 1963, under a nearly cloudless sky, more than 250,000 people, a fifth of them white, gathered near the Lincoln Memorial in Washington to rally for \u201cjobs and freedom.\u201d The roster of speakers included speakers from nearly every segment of society \u2014 labor leaders like Walter Reuther, clergy, film stars such as Sidney Poitier and Marlon Brando and folksingers such as Joan Baez. Each of the speakers was allotted fifteen minutes, but the day belonged to the young and charismatic leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had originally prepared a short and somewhat formal recitation of the sufferings of African Americans attempting to realize their freedom in a society chained by discrimination. He was about to sit down when gospel singer Mahalia Jackson called out, \u201cTell them about your dream, Martin! Tell them about the dream!\u201d Encouraged by shouts from the audience, King drew upon some of his past talks, and the result became the landmark statement of civil rights in America \u2014 a dream of all people, of all races and colors and backgrounds, sharing in an America marked by freedom and democracy.  For further reading: Herbert Garfinkel, When Negroes March: The March on Washington\u2026(1969); Taylor Branch, Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963 (1988); Stephen B. Oates, Let the Trumpet Sound: The Life of Martin Luther King Jr. (1982). \u201cI HAVE A DREAM\u201d (1963)  I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of whithering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the colored America is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the colored American is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.  One hundred years later, the colored American lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the colored American is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.  In a sense we have come to our Nation\u2019s Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.  This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d  But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.  We have also come to his hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.  Now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.  Now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.  Now is the time to make justice a reality to all of God\u2019s children.  I would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it\u2019s colored citizens. This sweltering summer of the colored people\u2019s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the colored Americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.  There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  We cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person\u2019s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \u201cfor white only.\u201d  We cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in Mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.  No, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.  I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of your trials and tribulations. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by storms of persecutions and staggered by the winds of police brutality.  You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.  Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our modern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.  Let us not wallow in the valley of despair. I say to you, my friends, we have the difficulties of today and tomorrow.  I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.  I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed. We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.  I have a dream that one day out in the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slaveowners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.  I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.  I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by their character.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.  I have a dream today.  I have a dream that one day every valley shall be engulfed, every hill shall be exalted and every mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plains and the crooked places will be made straight and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together.  This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope.  With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.  With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to climb up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.  This will be the day when all of God\u2019s children will be able to sing with new meaning \u201cMy country \u2019tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my father\u2019s died, land of the Pilgrim\u2019s pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring!\u201d  And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.  Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.  Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.  Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.  But not only that, let freedom, ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.  Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi and every mountainside.  When we let freedom ring, when we let it ring from every tenement and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God\u2019s children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old spiritual, \u201cFree at last, free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.\u201d",

    "user_input": "On August 28, 1963, some 100 years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the slaves, a young man named Martin Luther King climbed the marble steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. to describe his vision of America. More than 200,000 people-black and white-came to listen. They came by plane, by car, by bus, by train, and by foot. They came to Washington to demand equal rights for black people. And the dream that they heard on the steps of the Monument became the dream of a generation.  As far as black Americans were concerned, the nation\u2019s response to Brown was agonizingly slow, and neither state legislatures nor the Congress seemed willing to help their cause along. Finally, President John F. Kennedy recognized that only a strong civil rights bill would put teeth into the drive to secure equal protection of the laws for African Americans. On June 11, 1963, he proposed such a bill to Congress, asking for legislation that would provide \u201cthe kind of equality of treatment which we would want for ourselves.\u201d Southern representatives in Congress managed to block the bill in committee, and civil rights leaders sought some way to build political momentum behind the measure.  A. Philip Randolph, a labor leader and longtime civil rights activist, called for a massive march on Washington to dramatize the issue. He welcomed the participation of white groups as well as black in order to demonstrate the multiracial backing for civil rights. The various elements of the civil rights movement, many of which had been wary of one another, agreed to participate. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Racial Equality, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee and the Urban League all managed to bury their differences and work together. The leaders even agreed to tone down the rhetoric of some of the more militant activists for the sake of unity, and they worked closely with the Kennedy administration, which hoped the march would, in fact, lead to passage of the civil rights bill.  On August 28, 1963, under a nearly cloudless sky, more than 250,000 people, a fifth of them white, gathered near the Lincoln Memorial in Washington to rally for \u201cjobs and freedom.\u201d The roster of speakers included speakers from nearly every segment of society \u2014 labor leaders like Walter Reuther, clergy, film stars such as Sidney Poitier and Marlon Brando and folksingers such as Joan Baez. Each of the speakers was allotted fifteen minutes, but the day belonged to the young and charismatic leader of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had originally prepared a short and somewhat formal recitation of the sufferings of African Americans attempting to realize their freedom in a society chained by discrimination. He was about to sit down when gospel singer Mahalia Jackson called out, \u201cTell them about your dream, Martin! Tell them about the dream!\u201d Encouraged by shouts from the audience, King drew upon some of his past talks, and the result became the landmark statement of civil rights in America \u2014 a dream of all people, of all races and colors and backgrounds, sharing in an America marked by freedom and democracy.  For further reading: Herbert Garfinkel, When Negroes March: The March on Washington\u2026(1969); Taylor Branch, Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-1963 (1988); Stephen B. Oates, Let the Trumpet Sound: The Life of Martin Luther King Jr. (1982). \u201cI HAVE A DREAM\u201d (1963)  I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.  Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon of hope to millions of slaves, who had been seared in the flames of whithering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity. But one hundred years later, the colored America is still not free. One hundred years later, the life of the colored American is still sadly crippled by the manacle of segregation and the chains of discrimination.  One hundred years later, the colored American lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the colored American is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.  In a sense we have come to our Nation\u2019s Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our great republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.  This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given its colored people a bad check, a check that has come back marked \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d  But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and security of justice.  We have also come to his hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.  Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy.  Now it the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.  Now it the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.  Now is the time to make justice a reality to all of God\u2019s children.  I would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of it\u2019s colored citizens. This sweltering summer of the colored people\u2019s legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end but a beginning. Those who hope that the colored Americans needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.  There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the colored citizen is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.  We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.  We cannot be satisfied as long as the colored person\u2019s basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.  We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating \u201cfor white only.\u201d  We cannot be satisfied as long as a colored person in Mississippi cannot vote and a colored person in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.  No, no we are not satisfied and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.

This famous poem begins at a fork in a wooded path and ushers the reader along one \u201croad\u201d as a means of explaining that we must choose one way or another and not dilly-dally in life. No matter which way we go, we cannot foresee where it will take us, nor how the other would have turned out. We can do our best to make good decisions, but we\u2019ll never truly know how much worse or better an alternative might have been. And so, we mustn\u2019t regret the road not taken. The Road Not Taken\u201d is an ambiguous poem that allows the reader to think about choices in life, whether to go with the mainstream or go it alone. If life is a journey, this poem highlights those times in life when a decision has to be made. The speaker spends a while deliberating when he comes to a fork in the road, which symbolizes a choice he must make in his life.  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  And sorry I could not travel both  And be one traveler, long I stood  And looked down one as far as I could  To where it bent in the undergrowth;  Then took the other, as just as fair,  And having perhaps the better claim,  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;  Though as for that the passing there  Had worn them really about the same,  And both that morning equally lay  In leaves, no step had trodden black.  Oh, I kept the first for another day!  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  I doubted if I should ever come back.  I shall be telling this with a sigh  Somewhere ages and ages hence:  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I \u2014  I took the one less traveled by,  And that has made all the difference.",

It challenges you to go out and live your life in the present moment as a \u201chero\u201d and leave your mark on this world. \u201cA Psalm of Life\u201d by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow describes the purpose of life, and how one should handle the sorrow and struggles along the way. Throughout the poem, he intends to encourage the readers and urges them not to let the precious moments of life go in vain. He instructs them to keep a balance between happiness and sorrows and carve a better future for themselves. we should not spend our priceless moments sitting idly and doing nothing, rather we have to work hard towards reaching our goal and to make the most out of this short life.  Act! Take Action! Be Active!  Tell me not, in mournful numbers,  Life is but an empty dream!  For the soul is dead that slumbers,  And things are not what they seem.  Life is real! Life is earnest!  And the grave is not its goal;  Dust thou art, to dust returnest,  Was not spoken of the soul.  Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,  Is our destined end or way;  But to act, that each to-morrow  Find us farther than to-day.  Art is long, and Time is fleeting,  And our hearts, though stout and brave,  Still, like muffled drums, are beating  Funeral marches to the grave.  In the world\u2019s broad field of battle,  In the bivouac of Life,  Be not like dumb, driven cattle!  Be a hero in the strife!  Trust no Future, however pleasant!  Let the dead Past bury its dead!  Act, \u2014 act in the living Present!  Heart within, and God o\u2019erhead!  Lives of great men all remind us  We can make our lives sublime,  And, departing, leave behind us  Footprints on the sands of time;  Footprints, that perhaps another,  Sailing o\u2019er life\u2019s solemn main,  A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,  Seeing shall take heart again.

I hope it brings peace to some else out there.\u201d \u201cA joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor.\u201d Rumi\u2019s poem reveals the truth that being human is messy. Admit all feelings to the banquet of love or else they will destroy you by their insistence to be recognized, embraced, and admitted to full conscious awareness. Rumi validates my own life experience and inner knowing, reminding me to be grateful for all my inner family, the dark and the light, the shame and the triumphant spirit, the malice, and the generosity of spirit. In the Guest House Rumi is telling us that the entirety of the human experience is valuable. None of it is to be discounted as unnecessary or even avoidable. All emotions are valid and indeed desirable, even those we wish to evade. One moment is joyful, another is depressed, even meanness demands attention. Accept and honor them all, he says, because each portends a new state of being. Each is the portal to new awareness. Accepting each state is accepting the entirety of one\u2019s being. The shadow and the light carry equal weight.  This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they\u2019re a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in.
