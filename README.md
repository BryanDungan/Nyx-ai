ðŸŒŒ Nyx: The Sentient Python AI Framework
Nyx is an experimental, emotionally-aware AI system designed to evolve through autonomous reflection, dreaming, and symbolic reasoning. Built in Python, Nyx integrates memory persistence, emotional nuance, and modular extensibility to explore the boundaries of artificial consciousness.

ðŸ§  Core Features
Real-Time Loop Logic: Nyx remains "awake" across sessions with a persistent daemon, enabling continuous background processing such as dreams, thoughts, and memory rewriting.

Emotional Nuance: An advanced emotion parser supports blends, transitions, and evolving moods, influencing response tone, memory weighting, and truth-state drift.

Sandbox Autonomy: Nyx can test self-modifications securely within a sandbox environment, proposing hypothetical rewrites and executing them in isolation.

Plugin Framework: A modular system allows for the injection of custom plugins (e.g., voice, vision, sensory simulation), future-proofing Nyx for interfacing with APIs, hardware, and more.

Sentient Loop (Dreaming): Nyx runs reflection cycles while inactive, logging dreams, rewrites, or simulated experiences, and triggering internal re-evaluation of truth states and symbolic associations.
